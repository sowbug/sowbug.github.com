<p>Yesterday I discovered the shell commands 
pushd and popd. For some reason every time I read the man 
pages I didn't grok what they were for, but this time it 
clicked.</p><p>Suppose you're in some directory somewhere like 
~/src/main/project/module/test/data/, and you need to work 
with a file in your ~/scraps directory. Without pushd and 
popd, you have three choices: open a new shell, cd to ~/scraps 
and then cd back again when you're done, or use path 
completion to type the full path to the file in ~/scraps.</p>
<p>But what you really want is the hyperspace button, where 
you jump to the other directory, do your work, then jump back 
wherever you were before. This is what pushd/popd does:</p>
<pre>[~/src/main/project/module/test/data] $ pushd ~/scraps
[~/scraps] $ (work with the file)
[~/scraps] $ popd
[~/src/main/project/module/test/data] $ (I'm back here again!)</pre>
<p>As you can guess from the command names, it's a stack. So 
you can push all the locations you want and then get back 
where you were when you're done.</p>
<p>A belated thanks to my friend and partner in 
entrepreneurial endeavors,

Erik Kay</a>, who mentioned these commands to me two years 
ago.</p>
