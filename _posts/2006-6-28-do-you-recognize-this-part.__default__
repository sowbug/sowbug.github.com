I want to buy a connector that mates with this one. Here are all the clues.

This is the back of a 2007 Honda Fit OEM audio unit.
The connector has 20 pins.
Note that the two rows of pins are offset.
It is *not* the 14-pin CD-changer/MusicLink connector, which in this picture is the white connector next to it.
I have reason to believe that the Honda Civic also uses this connector.
