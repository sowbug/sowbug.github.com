Apologies to those of you getting 404s on the blog archives. I've migrated to Movable Type 4 and all the old links changed. Give the search engines a few days to catch up and things should be findable again.

<strong>Update: Apologies for the lack of space between paragraphs, too. Seems to be a bug in MT4.</strong>

<strong>Second update: Fixed the MT4 bugs; paragraph spacing should be correct now. I'm writing a new entry about how to fix yours.</strong>
