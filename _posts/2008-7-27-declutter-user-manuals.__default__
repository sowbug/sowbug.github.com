Lately, when my family buys anything with a user manual, part of my unboxing ritual involves going to the manufacturer's website, downloading the user manual as a PDF, and putting it somewhere safe. Then I throw away (er, I mean, recycle) the paper version. Less physical clutter, and searchable product documentation -- no matter how the manufacturer reorganizes its website in the coming years.
