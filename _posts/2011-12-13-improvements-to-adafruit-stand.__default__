The <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/462">Adafruit Standalone AVR ISP Programmer Shield Kit</a> is a bit of a niche product. It converts an Arduino into an AVR in-system programmer that doesn't require a PC to supply the target hex image. I added some <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/adaStandalone">improvements to the firmware</a>: it no longer has the 2x space overhead for ASCII hex files, instead working with pure binary; it fixes a bug with certain kinds of hex files; and it has better sounds to report success and failure.
