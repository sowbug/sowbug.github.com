Die-hard fans of this blog have been disappointed over the last few days. The usual daily itemization of what I've been eating is gone. 
On April 26, 2004, I began the South Beach Diet. The day before the diet I weighed 164.0 pounds. So far I have gotten as low as 156.0, and today am 158.0.

I think the diet works, and that it delivered on its promise to change the way I eat. You can read the book yourself if you like, but the basic idea is that you can teach yourself to satisfy your hunger with foods that don't mess with your blood-sugar levels. If you do that instead of snacking on foods that contain sugar, then you're more likely to be able to stay satisfied.

Practical example: for a snack, eat a piece of string cheese rather than a bunch of crackers. The cheese is high-protein, low-carb, but the crackers break down quickly into simple sugars and make you hungry again soon afterwards.

I'm going to stay on Phase 2 of the diet until my body-mass index is below 24.0. At that point I'd like to establish a +/- 5-pound range, since my weight normally fluctuates that much. That means a range from 147-157 pounds.
