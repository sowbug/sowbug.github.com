Mary and I watched the series finale of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica#2003_reimagining">Battlestar Galactica</a> this weekend, and I feel like I've run a marathon. At least, I do as much as anyone who watches <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">The Sci Fi Channel</a> will ever know what running a marathon feels like.

The most interesting thing I got out of the final show was that God must exist in the BSG universe. There was always a lot of religion in the show, of course, but religion exists independently of God's existence. In her final scene, Kara was either an angel or a very fast sprinter. I'll accept either possibility as sufficient proof of divine intervention. If angels exist, then God exists. I now need to rethink the words and actions of Head Six and Head Baltar, because they were probably real, rather than hallucinations.
