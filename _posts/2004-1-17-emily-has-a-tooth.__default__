Mary called last night and said Emily has a tooth! It's a lower front tooth. This explains why she hasn't been sleeping so well the past few nights.

Today Martha went to the drugstore and bought pretty much every item they sold for stopping baby tooth pain. The Oragel reportedly worked like a charm.
