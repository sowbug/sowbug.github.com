It's been about a year since I read <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033462?tag=sowbug-20">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a></em> by Gary Taubes and decided to follow its advice. <b>What a year it's been!</b> I've eaten well. I've never been hungry. I'm strong and alert. And measurable results? Look at 'em:

<ul>
	<li><strong>My weight is stable.</strong> As of this morning, I am within 2% of my lowest weight since freshman year of high school. To reiterate: <i>I weigh the same as I did when I was 14.</i></li>
	<li><strong>My lipid profile is amazing.</strong> Good cholesterol levels are high, bad ones are low, triglycerides are <i>half</i> the recommended limit of 150, and all the ratios are way better than recommended. They're better than the earliest personal measurement I have, which is from age 24.</li>
        <li><strong>My blood glucose is fine.</strong> Although I haven't measured it for about four months, it has always been on the high range of normal for fasting, random, and GTT. I have no reason to expect that they've changed.</li>
        <li><strong>My liver is in great shape.</strong> In 2009, several scans of my abdomen suggested fatty liver, which meant I likely had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. Another scan in October 2010 showed that my liver had returned to normal.</li>
        <li><strong>My energy level is incredible.</strong> In the twelve months of 2010, I designed, implemented, and shipped two iPhone apps, with a major update (an entire frickin' spaceship store) to one of them; as a contractor, I shipped another substantial e-commerce mobile application; I wrote a Django-based social networking prototype, learning a lot of Python and JQuery along the way; I got my pilot license current again; and I walked my kids 1.5 miles to school every morning.</li>
</ul>

Now, I don't have hard pre-diet data to possibly show any improvement correlated with my diet changes. But <i>I feel better than I've felt in years</i>, and because nothing else changed, <i>I know it's because I'm eating better</i>.

What's my secret? It's simple: <strong>avoid refined carbohydrates and sugar</strong>. Ignore everything else about food -- calories don't matter, sodium doesn't matter, fat doesn't matter. Carbs (including sugar) raise blood glucose levels, which elevate triglyceride and insulin levels and eventually cause so-called "diseases of civilization" such as diabetes, heart problems, obesity, and even cancer and Alzheimer's. <strong>Avoid carbs and you will probably avoid these diseases, too.</strong>

I said my secret was simple. But that doesn't mean it was easy, too. Just about everything in a typical American diet is full of sugar and refined carbohydrates. For example:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Flour</strong>. That's bread, pizza, pasta, lots of soups, croutons, sandwiches, tortillas, wraps, anything with a bun, almost anything deep-fried (because it's usually battered or breaded, too)....</li>
	<li><strong>Rice</strong>. Combined with the flour/sugar rules, Chinese food is a thing of the past, as well as sushi.</li>
	<li><strong>Sugar, corn syrup, honey, agave</strong>, etc. Besides the obvious pastries and candy, this means soda, anything at Starbucks that costs more than $2.00, any salad dressing with a hint of sweetness, and (surprisingly) a whole lot of foods that come in a box.</li>
</ul>

So what's left to eat? Mmmmm, lots!

<ul>
	<li><strong>All the eggs you want.</strong> Fortunately there isn't any link between dietary cholesterol and cholesterol levels in the blood, so eggs are pretty much the perfect food.</li>
	<li><strong>All the meat and fish you want, especially including bacon.</strong> The "saturated fat is bad" claim is, to put it delicately, <em>a total lie</em>. (Read GCBC for the sad story that led to this common belief.) In 'N' Out "Protein Style" Double-Doubles are perfect, as is salmon with pesto butter.</li>
	<li><strong>Nuts.</strong> Raw almonds and pecans are my favorite snack.</li>
	<li><strong>Cheese and milk.</strong> These dairy products actually aren't zero-carb, but getting whole milk and delicious high-fat cheese will slow the absorption and keep blood glucose from spiking.</li>
	<li><strong>Low-carb tortillas are a lifesaver</strong> as a bread substitute. Mine are 6 grams net carbs after subtracting all the carbs from dietary fiber.</li>
	<li>At a soup & salad bar, get the chicken soup (no noodles), then head over to the baked potato bar and <strong>load up the soup with sour cream, grated cheese, bacon bits, and green onions</strong>. So good, and so good for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Salads!</strong> Just make sure you avoid high-carb vegetables such as carrots, corn, potatoes, raisins, and most beans. A good rule of thumb is if the vegetable tastes sweet or starchy, then it has a high glycemic index, which is bad. Go for ranch dressing or oil & vinegar. No croutons!</li>
        <li>If you're ever in a situation as a guest at a restaurant or home where the only choices include refined carbohydrates, <em>eat your food with oil and protein!</em> That means extra butter and sauce on your pasta, with a couple extra meatballs. If you can't avoid carbs, at least slow them down.</li>
</ul>

Why did I embark on this dietary quest? Personal health reasons that I don't want to get into publicly, but let's just say that <strong>I am not a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis">angiogenesis</a></strong>. And now that I've tried it for a year, I can't imagine going back to my lethargic, occasionally overweight self. Even for pizza.

Interested? First, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033462?tag=sowbug-20">read the book</a>. You'll be surprised, perhaps a little put-out at media and government portrayal of healthy habits, and especially motivated to fix your diet. Get through the few days of low-carb induction. And if you make it, you'll never be hungry, you'll be able to eat as much as you want, you'll be healthier than you've ever been, and you'll accomplish more at work and in life than thought you could. <strong>Start today!</strong>
