<p>I think the U.S. drug industry is betting 
that the government will never allow Americans to import 
Canadian drugs.<p>I base this belief on a simple application 
of game theory. There are two possible cases: either the 
government will never allow imports, or it eventually will.</p>
<p>Start with the first case. If the government does not allow 
imports, then U.S. drug companies will continue to have a 
collective monopoly on the U.S. drug market and can continue 
to keep prices higher than import prices. Same as always.</p>
<p>But consider the second case. If the government eventually 
does allow imports, then U.S. drug companies will have to 
compete with import drugs, and thus will have to quickly 
reduce their prices in order to be competitive.</p>
<p>The second case would be a terrible situation for U.S. drug 
companies. If the drug companies honestly believed it might 
happen, then they'd do everything they could to prevent it. 
One effective way would be to reduce drug prices <em>now</em>, 
ostensibly to placate Americans, but really to quell the 
movement toward allowing imports. This would allow them to 
choose the lesser of two evils: having to charge lower prices 
for drugs but maintaining a collective monopoly, or having to 
charge lower prices because they're competing with imported 
drugs.</p>
<p>If this reasoning is correct, then the drug companies are 
predicting importation won't happen. Otherwise they'd begin 
lowering their prices now. Indeed, given the outcome of the 
presidential election, it seems that the prediction was 
correct.
