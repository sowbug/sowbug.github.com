This article documents my installation of an auxiliary audio jack in my 2007 Honda Fit.

First of all, if you're thinking of buying a Fit and are trying to decide between the Base model and the Sport model, you should probably buy the Sport. You would have to be crazy to go through what I did to add this Sport-only feature to a Base model, even though the price difference between the two trim lines is over $1,000. If your time is worth anything at all, this modification isn't worth it. In my case, it was a challenge that appealed to the hacker in me, so I enjoyed it.

And second, you're probably asking why I bought the Base model if the higher trim line had features I wanted. The reason is simple: the Sport is not just a fancier version of the Base, but rather it's a car with an entirely different character.

The Base is an inexpensive, sensible, compact-yet-roomy car. It gets good mileage, but I can easily carry oversized boxes in it. Typical Honda. I suspect that people who miss the old Civic wagon will love this car.

The Sport, however, is tricked out with a bunch of cheeseball features that I don't want on any car I drive. It has a spoiler on the back. It has a leather steering wheel cover. It has steering wheel paddle shifters. It has alloy wheels. And so on. Pretty much all the goofy ads you've seen for the Fit are supposed to appeal to people who dream of paddle shifters at night. (Rather than people like me who dream of dollar-cost averaging index fund purchases in their Roth IRAs.) Honda attempted to reach two different kinds of people through different trim lines for the same model. So non-sporty personalities like me who want basic creature comforts like remote keyless entry and cruise control are out of luck. I chose to buy the car that matched my personality (boring, economical, etc.) and add the couple missing features I wanted.

That takes care of why. Here's how.

First, I ordered part 39112-SAA-J02ZA, the OEM aux jack itself, from my friendly neighborhood online Honda dealer for about $30. I won't mention who they are because they turned out to be not so friendly; moreover, the online price after shipping and a mysterious "handling" charge was more than I'd have paid buying it list from a local dealer.

Next, I took apart the console in the car. This was fairly easy; there are two clips in the front and two screws in the back. You have to shift into neutral to get it out. Don't forget to unplug the cigarette lighter.

My hope at this point was to find a nicely taped-up plug waiting to be inserted into the back of the aux jack. No such luck. Honda didn't foresee adding this jack as an aftermarket option, so they actually have a different dashboard wiring harness for the Base. What a pain in the neck.

Next I used the online MusicLink installation instructions to tell me how to pull out the radio (or "tuner assembly" in the local lingo). My naive hope at <i>this</i> point was to find either female RCA jacks or a 3.5mm audio plug. Instead, I found a <a href="/mt/2006/06/do-you-recognize-this-part.html">different receptacle</a> that looked unlike anything I've ever seen on Planet Earth. The pain in my neck had now migrated down to my ass.

Several weeks of browsing Digikey and Jameco catalogs followed. I found nothing resembling the right connectors. I wrote various car-audio stores on the web, and the few shops that wrote back said they'd love to hear it if I solved the problem.

Eventually, I decided to take matters into my own hands and soldered ten RS-232 female headers (about $4 for 100 at Fry's) onto the ends of five wires from a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22monster+cable+sucks%22">cat-5 cable</a>. I wrapped each in electrical tape to prevent shorts. Using some info I found on the web, I concluded that the following pins matched up (5-pin on the aux jack, 20-pin on the radio): 1-15, 2-5, 3-3, 4-13, 5-14. (For the person who buys my car in a few years and wants to know which wire is which, the colors going into the aux jack are 1-O/W, 2-W/G, 3-G/W, 4-W/B, 5-B/W, O=orange, G=green, W=white, B=blue, and "O/W" for example means "orange wire with white stripe.")

Next came the hard part. I pulled out the head unit far enough to reach in behind it and held a mirror in back. Then after approximately 1,000 attempts I successfully pushed all five headers onto the right five pins on the back of the unit. Same with the aux jack, but that one was easier because I could look directly at it. I plugged in my MP3 player and confirmed it all worked, and then carefully reassembled the car (in the process breaking part 83442-SAA-003ZA, list price $3.20, and discovering that I must have broken two of part 91550-S50-000ZL, list price $1.68 each). I also dropped a screw down into the netherworld of the shifter assembly and spent about 45 minutes fishing it out.

I put on a motorcycle helmet and kissed the family goodbye, then drove the car around the block to make sure it still worked. No explosions or parts falling onto the road. The end result is identical to that of an OEM Sport, so I didn't take any pictures for you to see.

As I said earlier, don't do this. Just buy the Sport. But if you think as I do and decided that the Base model was right for you, but still want to play your MP3 player on your car stereo, this method definitely works. Final cost with parts (including replacements of the ones I broke) was about $50.
