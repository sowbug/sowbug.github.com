I've been researching VoIP for home. The dream scenario is being able to justify a huge broadband pipe to the home that, among other things, removes the need for a landline. 

The problems are:

(1) You can't get ADSL without a landline.
(2) My home can't get cable modem service.
(3) SDSL, which doesn't require a landline, is expensive.

Catch-22: to save money by replacing landline with VoIP, you need IP, which in the money-saving form requires a landline.

So I called Speakeasy. Turns out in July they expect to offer "dry pair" service, which means ADSL without piggybacking on a phone line.

Call for yourself and find out.
