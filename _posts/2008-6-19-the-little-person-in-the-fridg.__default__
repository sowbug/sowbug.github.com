There was supposed to be a light inside the refrigerator that came with our house, just like every other refrigerator in the world. But instead there were just a bunch of dangling wires. Fast-forward several years to last week, when I finally got around to putting in a switch and a light. Lemme tell you, having a light in the refrigerator <b><i>really freaks me out</i></b>. I can't get over thinking that there's a hole in the back with sunlight shining through every time I open it. And yes, I do peek through the crack as I'm closing it to make sure the light really does turn off.
