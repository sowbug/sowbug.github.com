These are the options I could strip from OpenSSL and still get it to build with RSA:

no-md2 no-md4 no-mdc2 no-ripemd no-rc2 no-rc5 no-idea no-cast no-des no-krb5 no-ec no-engine no-hw no-err

libeay32.dll is 572K.
ssleay32.dll is 128K.

Note that speed.c in the test suite wouldn't compile because DES was missing.
