I'm doing my first AdWords ads for <a href="http://www.attachmentcomputing.com/iletdown/">iLetDown</a>, so I've written a few ads like this:

<u>Relax and Pump Quickly</u>
Trigger your letdown reflex!
Buy iLetDown for iPhone.
www.attachmentcomputing.com

These were working fine until yesterday, when I tried to edit them slightly, and all my ads were halted because... <strong>Apple has asked Google to prohibit the trademarked "iPhone" term from being used in AdWords ads</strong>.

Huh? So the maker of this phone <em>that's being promoted as a platform</em> is preventing developers from advertising the fact that they've created products for that platform?

I stayed away from Apple for a long, long time, so maybe I'm just being naive about how this part of the world works. Does Apple always crap on its community like this?
