These days, almost any durable-goods purchase you make comes with an owner's manual. It's rare that anyone reads these manuals cover-to-cover, but as occasional reference material, they can be indispensable.

Why should a home be any different? In fact, aren't all the reasons for writing a manual especially applicable to a house? In this spirit, six months ago I started such a document. Among other things, it includes room/lot measurements, model numbers (to make it easier to order supplies or replacement parts, brands/colors of paint we've used on the walls, the names of plants we planted in the yard, where the water shutoff valve is, a leaving-for-vacation checklist, a returning-from-vacation checklist, and a running log of work we've done on the house.

It's so nice to measure a room once, and never have to measure it again. Likewise, it's wonderful to be able to order a water filter for the kitchen sink, without having to call my wife at home and ask her to crouch under the sink and read the model number to me.

The document is online, so I can share it with other family members. When ownership of our home changes hands, I hope the document goes along with it.
