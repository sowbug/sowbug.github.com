<p>For nearly seven years, Slashdot has been 
my primary source for geek news. Nearly everything I've read 
there was novel. But lately I've noticed that I rarely see 
anything on Slashdot that another RSS feed didn't already 
mention. Slashdot will continue to have some of the best 
commentary on geek topics, so of course I'll still read it, 
but currently RSS wins for timeliness.
