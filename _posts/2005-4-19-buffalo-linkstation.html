Buffalo Linkstation</a> or
<a href="http://kurobox.com/">
Kuro Box</a> using Windows XP, try turning off your computer's 
firewall. The setup program appears to use UDP in both 
directions, possibly sending and receiving on different ports, 
and the default settings of the XP firewall interfere with the 
traffic. I'm sure the setup program warns you somewhere to do 
this, but if you're like me, you typically ignore all those 
warnings. Well, this time they mean it.
