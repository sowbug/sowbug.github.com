So many people misspell "sneak peek" these days that it's almost become proper English. Reminds me of "chaise lounge," a misspelling of the French term "chaise longue" meaning "long chair."*

Nonetheless, here I am on a rampage about it. For the last time: a "peak" is the top of a mountain, and a "peek" is a look. You take a peek at a peak.

Setting aside the issue of spelling, the term is so overused that it's meaningless. For example, if you are publishing a "sneak peek" on a blog, there's nothing sneaky about it anymore; everyone can see it because it's now available on the web.

* More on this phenomenon on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_etymology">Wikipedia</a>. My favorite example is that "sweetheart" is a corruption of the original word "sweetard." Tonight I'll test-drive that term of endearment on my lovely sweetard wife Mary and see how my etymological defense holds up as she beats me to a pulp.
