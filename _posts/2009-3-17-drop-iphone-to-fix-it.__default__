My mom had an iPhone. One day the speaker went mute. Apple Store people show her a pink strip in the earphone jack, which apparently voids the warranty because the strip is a  water detector. Unknown how this happened, but she's a grandmother with a 2-year old living in her home, and there is at least one toilet in the house.

Anyway, I borrowed the phone because the display still worked, and I was thinking of writing an application for it. The other day I dropped the phone onto a rug from about waist height, and what do you know: the sound works again.

For you pink-jackers out there: give it a try. What do you have to lose?
