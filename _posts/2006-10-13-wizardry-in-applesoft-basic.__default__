Long, long ago, probably 1982, a friend gave me a copy of a program that was supposedly a prototype of a role-playing game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry">Wizardry</a>. I had just finished the real version of the game (which was written in Apple Pascal) and was astonished to see this crude, low-res graphics version written in Applesoft BASIC. It was done in way too much detail to be a forgery, and there were enough differences in the storyline that it really did seem to be something that could have involved into the final product.

Not recognizing the possibly long-term geek appeal of the program, I deleted it a few weeks later.

It's possible it was not what it appeared to be; maybe it wasn't a prototype but rather a knockoff programmed by an idle Wizardry fanboy who had neither the money to buy a real copy nor the moral makeup to pirate it. But either way, it would be cool to see it today. I wonder whether a copy of this BASIC program still exists on a dusty 5.25" floppy somewhere in the world.
