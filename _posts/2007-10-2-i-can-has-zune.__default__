A bullet point from the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/02/microsofts-new-zunes-officially-in-80-8-and-4gb-sizes/">Engadget article</a> caught my eye: "Additional native video codecs for h.264 and MPEG-4." Oh, really? If this is true, and you can drag, drop, and view MPEG-4/DivX videos, then the Zune suddenly got interesting. Only mildly interesting, mind you, but still interesting.

I'm still smarting from my purchase of a Toshiba Gigabeat S, which misleadingly implied in its advertising that it supported MPEG-4 video. The truth was that it played Windows Media Format videos that had been transcoded from other sources, including MPEG-4. By this reasoning, paper-pad cartoon flip books support Blu-Ray.
