This morning I mailed back my <a href="http://www.afmracing.org/">AFM</a> racing transmitter to collect my $100 deposit. The last time I rode my racebike for AFM was the day of my <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/cycle/buttonwillow.html">big crash</a> in 2001, and I'd never quite gotten around to giving up that last memento of my semi-imaginary life as a roadracer.
