I love where <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/13/texas-instruments-demos-first-720p-playback-from-a-mobile-phone/">this</a> is going. TI is building a phone that is capable of emitting, but not displaying, hi-def video. So you keep your favorite videos with you. Then when you're at a friend's house, you plug your phone into an 80-inch HDTV monitor and enjoy.

Even if cell phones someday have DLP capabilities, you'll still need a screen to project onto, and that takes as much real estate as a giant flat-panel TV. And a cell phone will never have an 80-inch display. Better to let each device specialize as much as possible: let cell phones get smaller and better at pushing bits around, and let displays get bigger and brighter.
