Tonight I was at a 6-handed no-limit hold 'em table (ring, not tournament). We were all having a nice time when a guy sits down with the max buy-in and starts going all-in on every hand. I mean <i>every</i> hand. A couple people lost their entire stack to him. The chat area started spewing messages with people screaming at him, calling him names, and so on. Eventually everyone left but me and him.

By this point in the story, you of course know what I did. I sat with him for 43 hands, folding all but five monsters: 77, K4o, K8o, JJ, AKs, and QTo. (OK, Kxo is trash, but in heads-up against a random hand it's still a slight (52-48) favorite.)

I busted him out, taking his money and that of the players he busted. He left after that. If only poker against sane players were this easy.
