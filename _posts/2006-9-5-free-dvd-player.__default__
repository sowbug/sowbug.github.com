HDMI cables are very, very, very expensive at your local electronics retailer. I've discussed this <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/archives/000215.html">before</a>, but have found a way around it for 6-foot HDMI cables.

At the moment, Best Buy is selling 4-foot HDMI cables for $149.99 (search for SKU 7129029). <a href="http://www.oppodigital.com/">Oppo</a> sells its highly rated <a href="http://www.oppodigital.com/proddetail.asp?prod=DV970HD">DV-970HD</a> DVD player for $149.00, and includes a six-foot, 24 AWG (not 26!), gold-plated HDMI cable with it.

So you can pay $149.99 to Best Buy and get a four-foot cable, or pay $149.00 to Oppo and get a six-foot cable. Oh, and Oppo throws in a DVD player for free.
