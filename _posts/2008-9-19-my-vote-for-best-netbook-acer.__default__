I own only one of the current generation of Atom-based notebook computers, so this isn't the voice of experience speaking, but my decision was the product of a fair amount of online research. I am very happy with my Acer Aspire One. I got the 1GB/120GB/XP Home/blue model.

Pros:

- I can do Java development in Eclipse on it. I prefer using a full-sized workstation, but I am genuinely productive on it.

- It doesn't have the half-sized misplaced right shift key that I never learned to use reliably on my Eee PC from last year.

- The 120GB hard drive is pretty much infinitely large for my cloud-friendly lifestyle (especially now that <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is out).

- The 1GB of DRAM is perfectly fine.

- It feels solid!

Cons:

- Oh dear, the shiny surface collects fingerprints more than any surface I can think of.

- The fan's a little too loud. In a meeting where people are listening intently to a speaker, it's just on the border of being annoying.

- I wish it had Bluetooth so I could easily sync pictures from my phone.

- The buttons on the side of the trackpad make single-hand cursor control difficult. I've gotten better at tapping, but for some operations it's not good enough.
