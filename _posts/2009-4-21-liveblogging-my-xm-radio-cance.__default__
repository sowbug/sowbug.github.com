OK, now the background: <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/2005/12/canceling-xm-radio.html">I've been through the process</a> of canceling XM radio before, and it was pretty painful. They really played all the dirty tricks on me: endless transfers with occasional dead ends, repeated confirmation of account numbers and mailing addresses, hidden phone numbers, etc. I wouldn't ever do business with them again, but Mary really liked having the radio, so a year or so later when we got a new car we signed up again. That car's since been replaced with a minivan, and the radio (which was permanently installed in that car) is no longer being listened to.

A recent web search of other people's experiences showed that as of recently the XM clowns were still doing the same kind of stuff. So I was not at all surprised when the "Cancellation Department" hung up on me this morning the moment I uttered the word "cancel."

However, I was surprised that I had to speak to only four people this time and dial only twice over the space of 18 minutes. (We'll see whether the charges on the credit card really do stop.) The first woman in the cancellation department had the "f*** you and your f***ing family" attitude the moment she answered the phone, but the second one was very bright and cheery. So maybe it's just luck of the draw.

Anyway, boring live blog. But I guess that's a good thing.
