A few months ago, Mary and I decided to throw out the booze in our liquor cabinet. She doesn't drink, and I barely do, and we needed the space for dishes. So out it all went, except for one weird little half-liter bottle that I'd brought back from a trip to China in 1994. It didn't feel right to toss it, so I opened it, had a sip, and put it in the freezer, and since then I've been occasionally drinking a shot of it after dinner, mixing it with juice from a lime.

Now, the smart thing to do would have been to keep doing this until the bottle was empty, then throw it out. But no. I just had to look it up on the web. Turns out Moutai is hard to get here in the United States. Moreover, a 15-year-old bottle is going for $450. Mine is 16 years old, and until recently was unopened and in perfect condition.

Whoops.
