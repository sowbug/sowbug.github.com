Just a quick post while cleaning off old receipts from the top of my dresser.

My family and I were in Australia last year and had a great experience with a rental car place called <a href="http://redspotcars.com.au/">Redspot</a>. They promised all-inclusive rates and delivered on that promise. I forget what the price was, but it was reasonable at the time. We got a car in Sydney and drove to the Blue Mountains for a day. The car worked, and nobody hassled me about damage or mileage (kilometerage?) or anything when I returned it at the airport the next day. In the unlikely event you're about to visit Australia and need a car for a few days, give Redspot a call when you get there.
