A quickie for the Rails developers in the audience.

Step 1: At the top of your spec file, add <code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby -S bundle exec rspec</code>
Step 2: <code>chmod +x spec/models/whatever_spec.rb</code>

Now it's easy to run that one specfile that's giving you trouble, without remembering the command-line magic to run a single test. Works (with modifications) with Cucumber files, and probably TestUnit, too.
