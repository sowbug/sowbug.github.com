I did the flight portion of my BFR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biennial_flight_review">biennial flight review</a>) a few days ago, and while refreshing my memory beforehand dredged up the <a href="/assets/docs/Checkride_prep_miket.pdf">study outline (pdf)</a> I made while studying for my checkride in 2007. Enjoy.

Disclaimer: everything in it is outdated, incorrect, and specific to planes you don't fly. You should make your own outline for it to be safe and of any pedagogical value to you as a pilot.
