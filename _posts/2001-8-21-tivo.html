<p>These are notes, mostly to myself, about the Tivo I got on August 21, 2001.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Model HDR31204 (standalone, Phillips, single-drive, 30 gigabytes, Quantum
    LCT20, version 1.3).</li>
  <li>Quantum drive is really, really quiet.</li>
  <li>Downloaded <a href="http://www.9thtee.com/">MFSTools</a> and backed up.
    <ul>
      <li>Backup was going to be 6 gigs but it failed (couldn't write more than
        2 gigs to a file on Windows FAT32 partition).</li>

      <li>Tried again with -Tl32 option and the backup was 1.1 gigs, compressed
        (gzip -9) 383 megabytes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The CR2032 backup battery was never installed in my Tivo. They just plain
    forgot to do it! I had to go to Target and buy one.</li>
  <li>The setup screens are very slick.</li>
  <li>I have a AT&amp;T Digital Cable General Instruments cable box. This
    product/service already sucked ass, but it's so much worse with a Tivo:
    <ul>

      <li>Can't change channels above 99</li>
      <li>Channel changing is slow</li>
      <li>Already-annoying banner following every successful channel change is
        even more annoying)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The program-grabbing stage takes a very long time (about 4 hours for me).
    It ends up being an almost out-of-body experience. The estimated time never
    seems to admit that it's going to take longer than it originally thought.
    Rather than using actual elapsed time as a basis for estimating remaining
    time, it seems to use original estimate multiplied by percentage remaining,
    so you get subjective minutes that objectively last 2-3 minutes, kind of
    like the clock in my grade school.</li>
  <li>The next scheduled update call was June 15. I assume that means that if I
    hadn't manually started an update, it wouldn't have updated for 10 months.</li>

  <li>There was a bunch of demo videos on the machine. The content wasn't very
    interesting but it was really nice to see how high-quality the video was. It
    looked much, much better than my cable, which I may have mentioned sucks
    ass.</li>
</ul>
