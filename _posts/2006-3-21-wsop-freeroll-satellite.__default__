Tonight I'm going to live blog my entry into a satellite tournament for the <a href="http://www.worldseriesofpoker.com/">World Series of Poker</a> main event. This is actually the second level of this satellite. I entered a freeroll tournament on <a href="http://www.pokerstars.com/">PokerStars</a> last week for 100 FPP (think frequent-flier miles; same idea) and won entry into the second-level satellite, worth 1,000 FPP. I wasn't going to enter this tournament, but after some back-and-forth with PokerStars Support I learned that these are special FPPs, not good for anything but tournament buy-ins, so I'm taking the plunge.

At the moment (58 minutes before the tourney starts), there are 179 entrants and one winner, so assuming the number of entrants triples by the time it starts and that I'm of average skill and luck, I have only a 0.18% chance of winning. But that's the last of the loser talk. I have Gloria Gaynor's <i>I Will Survive</i> queued up in Winamp and am ready to rip up the field.

The event starts at 8:00 tonight Pacific time; it's tournament #21469777 and I'm Sowbug. Stay tuned for further updates....

<hr>

4 min before start, and 396 players. My chances are all the way up to 0.25%!

Knocked out on the bubble on my warmup 1-table SNG. Hope that's not an omen.

Here we go! Table 11.

First hand, 3 people all-in on flop, they chop to a board straight. One trips, one TPTK, one AK. Mostly OK to bet those, but all-in?

Wow, two of those guys all-in again, AA vs. two pair. One's nearly gone.

Here I go, T9s calling his all-in.

.... and I'm down to t52. Two pair against his flopped straight and he moved all-in on me. I figured TPTK or high pockets. OK, fine, but did I have to call him?

Not dead yet, but down to t208. This situation obviously sucks, but my M is still almost 7, so I can wait a couple more rounds and double up.

I know I can work my way back to health. I've folded K9s and A7o in late position. Waiting for a monster starting hand. It will come in time.

<i>First I was afraid, I was petrified...</i>

AQs, let's try to see a flop.

Nope, was raised & I folded. Now t138. Flop was A47... Would have tripled up against AJ & AT.

Folded AQo UTG. Amazing, I'd have QUINTUPLED up.

Folded A6s in BB after big early-position raises. t108. 

SB brings 48o. t93. Blinds up, M now 2.

320 players left. Must outlast only 319 of them.

The guy who cripped me is up to t6813 after <i>his</i> two pair knocks someone out. :)

BB, J3o, lots of limpers...... flopped middle pair. Nope, didn't happen. t63.

SB, 96s. limpers, right odds.... called. Aw, horrible flop. Great, my M is sub-1. t33. I get to see at most 12 more cards before I'm blinded out.

8 more cards.

This is it. Pocket 9s. Three callers. I'm very dead.

One of the callers made trip aces. The other guy had me beat, too, with two pair.

END TRANSMISSION

<b>Update: I felt so dissatisfied with my early flameout in this tourney that I entered a $4.40 180-player SNG and busted out 10th -- in the money, though just before the big money. My 2nd-best MTT finish to date! (best was 39th out of 1386 in a $3 tourney.)</b>
