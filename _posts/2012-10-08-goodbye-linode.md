I turned off my [Linode](http://www.linode.com/) virtual server yesterday, and it made me sad. Linode is pretty awesome: great web UI, reasonable prices, uptimes in the many many many hundreds of days. I'll use them again in the future, and I recommend you do, too.

Meanwhile, I didn't need a server anymore. I've moved sowbug.org's blog posts to [GitHub](https://sowbug.github.com/), and I'm slowly restoring some of the static content that used to live on that site and a couple others that also lived on that server. No ETA.
