This has been driving me crazy for almost two years. On satellite radio back in 2005 I heard the song "Do You Wanna Funk" by Patrick Cowley & Sylvester. The song was familiar; I was certain I'd heard it in a movie soundtrack, but I absolutely could not place it. And the web was no help.

This morning I heard the song again, so I tried searching again, and this time found it. According to <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805072500?ie=UTF8&tag=sowbug-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0805072500">The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the 70s in San Francisco</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sowbug-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0805072500" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/></i> by Joshua Gamson, as scanned and indexed by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LwIGcuy_xxMC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=%22do+you+wanna+funk%22+soundtrack&source=web&ots=VPLWtCBPRJ&sig=UMBNBeQ_1Ckh_h9Ifxqa78xKgvQ">Google Book Search</a>, the answer is... <i>Trading Places</i>. I think it's the scene where Billy Ray Valentine reacts to his newfound privilege and riches by throwing a party in his home.

Note that the book is copyrighted 2005, which means it might not have been in print yet when I first did my search. Thank you, Joshua Gamson! Thank you, Google Book Search!

<b>Update: Trading Places, not Spaces! Aargh, my domesticity is showing!</b>
