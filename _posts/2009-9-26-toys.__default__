This morning my kids were playing with the following toys on the kitchen floor:

Two plastic dogs;
One Transformer (Bumblebee);
One stuffed bear wearing a t-shirt;
One SD card, size 1GB.

That last toy didn't exist when my daughter was born in the early 2000s, and its storage equivalent would have cost more than a thousand dollars.

What a wonderful world we live in.
