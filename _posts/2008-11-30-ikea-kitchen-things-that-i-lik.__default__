I was getting sick of taking care of delicate nonstick pans, so when I saw this iron pan, I figured I'd give it a try. It's a little bit of work to keep it both seasoned and clean, but it's worth it, because it heats so evenly and handles tricky foods like over-easy eggs so well. Plus, it cost only about $10 and looks like it'll last forever.

This thing is for frothing coffee. I also use it for mixing hot chocolate, as well as the orange powder that comes with boxed macaroni and cheese. It's a little too small for scrambling an egg or mixing up a fruit smoothie, but its size does make it very easy to clean. It takes two AA batteries and cost about $2.

<b>Update</b>: improved language to make it clear that I don't mix chocolate & cheese together.
