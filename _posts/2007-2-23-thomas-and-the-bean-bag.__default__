Yesterday I bought a yellow bean bag for the kids to play on at home.

I walk in the front door and plop down this big blob on the living room floor. Emily and Thomas scream in delight and four seconds later Thomas has unzipped it and spilled out the stuffing. We press pause. Thomas and I have a talk.

"The stuffing needs to stay in the bean bag. Don't let out the stuffing, OK?"

"OK."

"The zipper is not for playing. Don't play with the zipper, OK?"

"OK Daddy."

Put the stuffing back in, vacuum up the rest. Press play again.

I leave the room for another four seconds. I return and Thomas has unzipped the bean bag and spilled out the stuffing.

No more bean bag in the living room.
