This is a followup to my <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/2009/01/crown.html">previous post</a> about my crown.

During the second visit, my dentist pulled off the temporary crown and then glued on the permanent one. We discovered that one small part of the porcelain touched the opposite tooth, making my bite uncomfortable. By the time that part was ground away, the metal beneath the porcelain was showing. My dentist offered to redo it, but I declined. The blemished crown looks like a tooth with a small filling in it, which in fact makes it less noticeable because the tooth next to it also has a (real) filling in it.

To me, the crown looks like somebody else's tooth hanging out in my mouth, but otherwise it has fulfilled its two responsibilities of chewing food and not hurting. Money well spent.
