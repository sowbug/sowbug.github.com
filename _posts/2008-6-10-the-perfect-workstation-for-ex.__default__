My team is moving to new offices in Redwood City, and we've resolved to lay out our workspace in an XP-friendly bullpen style that favors pair programming and impromptu meetings.

While visualizing our new digs, I had an idea. What if, instead of making it easy to gather around a single computer, the computer itself were mobile? Laptops aren't the answer; I can't write code of any depth without an ergonomic keyboard and a mouse, and I am addicted to giant LCDs. So I'm looking for a tiny rolling workstation stand with a VESA monitor arm, an adjustable keyboard/mouse tray, and a UPS so I can move around without shutting down the PC. A quick search on the web produced many contenders that I had to rule out for various reasons: too ugly (wood laminate), too fragile-looking, keyboard tray not sufficiently adjustable to the 26-inch height I prefer, not really compatible with a VESA mount, or priced for verticals rather than the consumer market.

<a href="http://www.universalpart.com/Aluminum-Mobile-Computing-Workstation-Cart_item_4198.html">This</a> is the closest to what I have in mind.

<form mt:asset-id="10" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img alt="Rolling PC Workstation" src="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/P4356a.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"/></form>

But I wanted more of a flexible monitor arm so that we could easily move the monitor around according to whoever's coding at the moment, and I'd imagined the keyboard tray jutting forward a little more, both to counterbalance the monitor arm (visually if not physically) and to enable me to stretch my legs out a bit underneath without straddling the PC. And if I ditch the included tray and monitor mount and replace them with my own, then I'm paying $250 for a rolling pole, which doesn't feel like such a great deal.

Any ideas? By the way, I decided to disable blog comments after a barrage of unsuccessful spam attacks, so if you have an idea, post it somewhere on the web, and my Google Web Alerts will eventually pick it up.
