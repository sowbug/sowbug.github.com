Hey, Google! (And other providers of web services.)

Some of you have scaled back your twentysomething, 100-hour/week engineering lifestyles and started families. If so, have you noticed how nice it'd be to be able to share email addresses with your spouse and maybe your kids? Or create a task list that's a joint to-do list for the household? Or log into your own email account and approve new senders for your kids' email accounts? Or have a single email address that's the "household" email address, but doesn't require everyone to log into that account and share a password?

The marketing department calls these "enterprise features." But you know what? A family is an enterprise, too! Not in the SLA or guaranteed-support senses, but definitely in the we-have-complicated-relationships-among-ourselves sense. No, we don't want to set up a domain, or change our email addresses, or designate Dad as the administrator with access to the family's control panel. (Google Apps would be perfect if we did.) We just want those enterprise features!

The consumer/enterprise distinction is frustrating because (a) each side in fact needs the other side's features, and (b) the distinction <em>really</em> doesn't make sense when either version is free anyway. Please break down that feature wall. Help me share my contact list with my wife!
