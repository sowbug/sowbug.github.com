Here is a way for dads to contribute to the baby-raising process. You can make formula in batch!

You need a 32-ounce Nalgene bottle, an empty gallon jug, and a small measuring cup. Also, I assume that you have regular formula, which is one scoop per 2 ounces. 
First, cut the jug in half. This makes a funnel.

<a href="/assets/img/funnel_2.jpeg"><img alt="23 ounces" src="/assets/img/funnel_2-thumb.jpeg" width="160" height="120" border="0" /></a> Next, fill the bottle to 23 ounces. Some formula instructions specifically mention this figure.

<a href="/assets/img/funnel_3.jpeg"><img alt="One cup formula" src="/assets/img/funnel_3-thumb.jpeg" width="160" height="120" border="0" /></a> Using the jug funnel, fill up the measuring cup to one 8-oz cup (again, this was listed on my formula can). I put in a little extra so my daughter will grow up to be super-smart.

 I think you can figure out the rest from here, but just bear with me and read the rest of the article. Put the funnel in the bottle, then pour the cup of formula in.

<a href="/assets/img/funnel_5.jpeg"><img alt="Shake well" src="/assets/img/funnel_5-thumb.jpeg" width="160" height="120" border="0" /></a> Seal the bottle tight and shake like crazy. Wait a little bit for the foam to settle down.

Now pour into six waiting bottles, and you have your army ready to combat hunger! <a href="/assets/img/funnel_6.jpeg"><img alt="Formula ready to go" src="/assets/img/funnel_6-thumb.jpeg" width="160" height="120" border="0" /></a>

After writing this up I see how little I've innovated here, but it's worth sharing because I never spill using this method, and I never end up with lumps in the bottles.
