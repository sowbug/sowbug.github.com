AVG decided to shoot themselves in the foot and run a near-daily popup ad campaign on their Anti-Virus Free Edition users' machines. Here's a response to user complaints written by one of their volunteer forum moderators:

<blockquote>Don't forget that you are privileged to be using an available Free AV product so you can expect AVG Technologies to be trying to encourage you to use their Pro (paid for) version. In the end of the day it's not really a lot to put up with....</blockquote>

Any response to this attitude is tilting at windmills, but I can't resist pointing out the irony that AVG uses the very same tactics (annoying popup ads) that their product is supposed to eliminate (malware can be responsible for annoying popup ads, among many other things).

Any recommendations for free antivirus software that has a better attitude toward their customers?
