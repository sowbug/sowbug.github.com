It's been almost ten years since I left Los Angeles. One of my best L.A. food memories is a little restaurant called <a href="http://www.hurrycurryoftokyo.com/">Hurry Curry</a>. I always ordered the same thing: steamed rice with a bowl of Japanese chicken curry poured over it. You had to ask them to make it about 10x hotter than their spiciest in order to get any real kick, but once you did, boy was it delicious.

I visited Pasadena recently and thought I was hallucinating when I saw a Hurry Curry across the street from the downtown Coffee Bean. But sure enough, they'd opened a second location, and it was just as good as the first. It made me miss L.A. even more.

If you know of a place on the Peninsula that sounds like Hurry Curry, please let me know. Meanwhile, here's a recipe I made up that is a fast-food MSG-laden facsimile of my favorite curry dish:

White rice
1 chicken breast
1 cup of water
2 cubes S&B Golden Curry, hot

Steam the rice. Fry the chicken. Boil the water and toss in the curry cubes. Reduce to simmer. Slice up the chicken and put it in the curry. Let it bubble for about 15 minutes, and then pour it on the rice. Makes one serving. <em>It's possible that you can skip the chicken-frying step, but I'm not sure how much longer you'd have to simmer. I fry the chicken so I'm sure it's cooked all the way through.</em>
