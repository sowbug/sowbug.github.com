So far, in 2009, the monthly amount on my Comcast cable bill has changed <em>four times</em>. This is for plain old cable TV -- no internet, no phone, no metered usage, no pay-per-view, no changes whatsoever to the service. Sometimes the actual cable service price changes. Sometimes the taxes change. Sometimes the surcharges change. Sometimes the fees change. It makes no sense to me.

I suspect part of my cable bill pays Comcast employees whose sole job it is to meet regularly in committee and institute inscrutable changes to my bill. The tools of their trade are probably dice and a Ouija board. It's annoying, but I suppose I'm supporting the economy by keeping them employed.

If anyone has an explanation why there is so little slack in Comcast's finances that they really must make pricing adjustments of as little as 0.02% about every two months, I'd appreciate hearing it.
