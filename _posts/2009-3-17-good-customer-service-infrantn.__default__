One of my all-time favorite electronics purchases is my <a href="http://www.readynas.com/">Infrant ReadyNAS</a>. It's a file server that's barely bigger than the four SATA drives it contains. We keep all 100+ GB of our family photos on it. (With periodic offsite backups, of course.)

The other day I walked into my home office and smelled burning electronics. I wish I could say this were a rare occurrence in the Tsao household, but that's the price a tinkerer pays to lead an adventurous life. Fortunately, this time it wasn't my fault: the ReadyNAS was dead, almost certainly because of a popped capacitor. After a few online searches I determined that mine was likely within a range of recalled units that had a flaky power supply.

So on a grim Saturday night I called an 800 number. I promptly got an answer. I explained my problem exactly once; I gave my name and shipping address exactly once; I provided a credit card number exactly once as security to allow cross-shipping of the good and defective parts. No apologies for hold times, no transferring to supervisors, no hassle. A few days later I received a box with a new power supply in it and a prepaid shipping label for the return. My file server was back in business!

I admit that I was worried when Netgear purchased Infrant a couple years ago, but if it means it's cost-effective for them to hire competent, courteous phone people even on a weekend night, I'll accept it.
