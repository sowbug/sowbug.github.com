From <a href="http://democrats.sen.ca.gov/servlet/gov.ca.senate.democrats.pub.members.memDisplayPress?district=sd10&ID=2102">this press release</a>:

"Google defends its unprecedented intrusion into private e-mail conversations by arguing that Gmail subscribers knowingly consent to it. But those who send e-mails to Gmail subscribers from elsewhere (like Earthlink or Yahoo!) will not be asked for their consent before the whole e-mail conversation is analyzed."

Guess what: senders aren't asked for consent when recipients do <i>anything</i> with e-mails. I can post my e-mail on the side of a bus if I want to, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

As long as Sen. Figueroa is at it, why not outlaw the "forward" button on all e-mail clients?

Aaargh!
