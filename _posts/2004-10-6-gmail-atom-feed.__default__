A couple days ago an undocumented feature appeared on <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a>.  It's an <a href="http://atomenabled.org/">Atom</a> feed, which is a syndication format (compare RSS), and as implemented in Gmail it gives you a summary of the unread mail in your inbox. Here are my observations; I'd appreciate corrections if I've gotten anything wrong or left anything out. In particular, have you had success or failure with a particular aggregator?

<ul>
<li>The link to the feed is <a href="https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom">https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom</a>.</li>
<li>The feed requires SSL. http:// rather than https:// won't work (though it will redirect if your aggregator supports it).</li>
<li><s>The URL must be exact. Adding a trailing slash won't work.</s> <b>Fixed this 10/21/2004.</b></li>
<li>For most aggregators, the feed requires HTTP authentication. Your aggregator should prompt you for  your Gmail username and password when you first subscribe.</li>
<li>For most browsers or browser-integrated aggregators, the feed will work with your Gmail web cookie. You don't need to enter your username/password through HTTP authentication, but the feed will work only as long as you're logged in to Gmail, which isn't particularly useful.</li>
<li>The content of the feed is the unread messages in your inbox. If you don't have any such messages, you won't see any interesting content in the feed!</li>
</ul>
These are the aggregators that I've tested with the Gmail Atom feed:
<ul>
<li>Sage: this Firefox extension works through session cookies.</li>
<li>Feedreader: doesn't work because it doesn't support SSL.</li>
<li>SharpReader: yes, it works because it supports SSL and HTTP authentication.</li>
<li>Bloglines: doesn't work because it doesn't support SSL, and even if it did, I'm not willing to give my Gmail password to anyone else.</li>
<li>FeedDemon: I've heard this works but I haven't tried it.</li>
<li>NetNewsWire 2.0b3: works (Thanks, Matt!)</li>
<li>BottomFeeder: works (Thanks, JH!)</li>
</ul>
And finally, these are aggregators that claim compatible featuresets (SSL and HTTP authentication), but that I haven't tested or heard anyone else testing with the Gmail Atom feed:
<ul>
<li>Shrook 2 </li>
<li>NetNewsWire </li>
<li>NewzCrawler</li>
<li>NewsGator</li>
</ul>
