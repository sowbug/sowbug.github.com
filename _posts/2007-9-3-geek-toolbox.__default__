I've been meaning to start a list of stuff that any self-respecting geek will have in his or her toolbox when out exploring in the world. These criteria are intentionally broad, and I don't want to limit the list by any specific constraint, such as weight, mass, or purpose.

<ul>
<li>A wristwatch. Although many devices these days think they know what time it is, it's good to have a low-tech device that you can trust.</li>
<li>An alarm clock. Most cell phones have a built-in software alarm clock, but they do you no good on a three-day camping trip after their batteries run out.</li>
<li>A multimeter. Nothing too fancy; just enough to test voltage, continuity, and maybe resistance, any of which might restore your sanity in a flash when you can't tell which of several parts of a contraption is broken.</li>
<li>Zip-ties. Get some big ones and a lot of small ones.</li>
<li>A sledgehammer. I'm very happy with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000ELWH5Q&tag=sowbug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">this one</a>. Much better for ad-hoc pounding or smashing than a piece of wood or a soon-to-be-never-the-same-again book.</li>
<li>A few dozen feet of rope as well as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LZgKEFbpdk">knowledge</a> how to tie at least one good knot. For most purposes, this is just as good as tie-down straps or aircraft wire. A couple carabiners are nice, too, but not essential.</li>
<li>A cigarette lighter. Or strike-anywhere matches, your preference.</li>
<li>A pair of multi-purpose shears.</li>
<li>Several different sizes of bungee cords.</li>
<li>Sunscreen.</li>
<li>A towel.</li>
<li>A compass, or at least some very basic <a href="http://www.quietbay.net/Science/astronomy/nightsky/">knowledge</a> about which way is North.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00009OYH8&tag=sowbug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">power inverter</a>. As long as you have a car nearby, you'll also have AC power. Just be careful about wattage, or else you'll soon have neither.</li>
<li>Duct tape.</li>
<li>An LED headlamp. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rayovac-Sportsman-LED-Headlight-Pack/dp/B000FKJLEQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-8709434-2868429?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1188845767&sr=8-1&tag=sowbug-20">This one</a> is my all-time favorite because it has night-vision red, reasonably bright white, and a third Krypton mode if you need extremely bright or more natural wavelength light.</li>
<li>A high-intensity utility light. I wouldn't bother with rechargeable models; if you don't have AC power, either wait until daytime or use a headlamp.</li>
<li>An adjustable wrench. You'll curse yourself for not bringing a full socket set, but it's better than nothing.</li>
<li>Work gloves. You can do anything once without gloves, but once might not be enough.</li>
<li>Earplugs. Preferably a bunch of individually wrapped pairs, so you don't have to reuse an old pair with unknown history.</li>
<li>Safety goggles.</li>
</ul>

I have purposely excluded various useful electronic devices (cell phone, laptop, GPS, scanner radio, portable printer) because they tend to be unavailable at any distance from civilization. They tend to need a battery recharge just when you need them most, as well.

Did I miss anything?
