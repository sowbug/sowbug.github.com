Mary and I are keeping a list of funny or whimsical things the kids say while they're still tots. I'm not going to publish the list yet because most of them are "you had to be there... for two years straight"-kinds of things, and I want to test the staying power of their humor before sharing them with the world. But one's worth writing about now, because it's just plain weird.

About a year ago Emily began insisting that we "gotfor" various things. "Dad, you gotfor your keys!" "You gotfor me! Wait for me!" We applied our usual corrective method: stopping the conversation and asking "Emily, is it 'gotfor' or 'forgot'?" After about 400 repetitions of this drill she broke the habit, and since then we're accused only that we "forgot" something.

End of story? Not quite. Along comes Thomas, 17 months younger, and about two months ago he independently invents "gotfor," which he's been diligently using ever since. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gotfor+forgot">quick search</a> shows we're hardly alone. There's a small contingent of the blog-o-web that believes this is clear evidence of dyslexia, but for now I'm just going to find it amusing and leave it at that.
