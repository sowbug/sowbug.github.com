My <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/2008/09/android-on-a-netbook.html">prediction about availability of Android on a netbook</a> by the end of 2008 didn't quite come true, but <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/01/01/android-netbooks-on-their-way-likely-by-2010/">it was not too far off</a>.

Next challenge: who will port Android to the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22alpha+400%22">Alpha 400</a>?
