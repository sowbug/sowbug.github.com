My first iPhone app is available on the Apple iTunes App Store!

<a href="http://www.attachmentcomputing.com/iletdown?rt=sbo-1">iLetDown</a> helps moms express breast milk quickly and easily by helping trigger the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation#Milk_ejection_reflex">let-down reflex</a>. <a href="http://www.attachmentcomputing.com/iletdown?rt=sbo-1">Visit the iLetDown site</a> to learn more.

You're probably wondering why I picked such a specific market segment (working, lactating moms who buy apps for their iPhones) rather than something general like <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/GreenThumbForIPhone">a puzzle game</a>. Mostly it was because I knew that marketing my own product would be hard. I wanted to learn the ropes with an app that I could write relatively quickly, rather than investing many months in a game and then making lots of mistakes with its marketing.

Do you know anyone who recently had a baby and is going back to work? If so, please <a href="http://www.attachmentcomputing.com/iletdown?rt=sbo-1">let her know about iLetDown</a>. Makes a great gift!
