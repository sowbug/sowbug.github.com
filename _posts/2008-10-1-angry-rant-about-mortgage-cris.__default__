Ask a random person what the American Dream is, and there's a good chance you'll get an answer along the lines of having a house with two cars in the garage and a nicely manicured lawn.

This is not the American Dream.

The American Dream is living in a country where you get to go to school instead of working in a factory through your childhood. It's having someone answer the phone when you dial 911. It's getting a job and keeping it in spite of the fact that your religion, race, place of birth, or last name is different from that of your boss. It's having an impartial court instead of a baseball bat to enforce legal contracts. It's starting a business without having to bribe corrupt officials.

The American Dream is not about <em>having</em>. It's not even about <em>earning</em>. It's about <em>living in a place where earning is even possible</em>. It's certainly not about promising to pay a mortgage of $4,000 a month when you earn $55,000 a year because the "american dream" entitles you to do so.
