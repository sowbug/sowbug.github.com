<p>It should be illegal to give a child a gift of a toy that makes noise unless it's accompanied by a signed, notarized affidavit that the would-be giver has first spent 24 hours locked in a darkened room listening to the toy nonstop. In many cases, a person would be certifiably insane after this experience and thus lack the mental capacity to legally attest to anything (including the toy affidavit). Problem solved.</p>
