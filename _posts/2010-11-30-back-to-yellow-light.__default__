I got some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00303FNRO?ie=UTF8&tag=sowbug-20">5000K CFL bulbs</a> after reading the glowing (ha) reviews about how the higher-temperature blue light was more like real sunlight and made those on whom it shined happier and healthier.

I installed two in the overhead globes in our kitchen and was instantly transported to a fluorescent-lit basement. It's odd that the bluish light is referred to as having a higher "temperature" than yellowish light, because it feels colder. After a few days, though, I got used to it. I started to appreciate that things were the same color during the day as they were at night. Yellow lights in the rest of the house started to feel artificial. The kids agreed, too; they thought the bluish-white lights were cool (again with the mismatched temperature names!).

But Mary runs this house, and she has a 50.1% majority voting stake. Today we went back to the regular yellow CFLs. I suppose I'll use the blue ones in my office.
