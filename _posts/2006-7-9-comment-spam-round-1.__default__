I spent the morning hacking on my Movable Type CMS. The goal is to make it a tiny bit harder for low-life comment spammers to fill this blog with crap (which is <i>my</i> job). It should be unnoticeable to human users.

Help me test! If you're a well-intentioned human, please leave a non-spam comment on this entry. Otherwise, please don't leave a comment.
