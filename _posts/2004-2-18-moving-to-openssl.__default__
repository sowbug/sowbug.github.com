Over the past couple of weeks I've been getting <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> to build on Windows, and I've been writing test programs to explore the API. I have also removed all the custom encryption code in WINW, which is a good thing. I like the BIO abstraction in OpenSSL; it's similar to what I was trying to do in WINW, but it's better. The similarities have also made it pretty easy to integrate WINW and OpenSSL.
