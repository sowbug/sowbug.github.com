Here's the latest batch of style errors that I've made all my life.

<i>She was here, however, he was there.</i>

This is a run-on sentence. The comma before "however" should be a semicolon. It would also be OK to have "however" start a new, second sentence. I'm pretty sure that "however" is an adverb in this sentence, but I've been using it as some sort of magic conjunction that has special punctuation rules.

<i>She believes he is there. Which is true.</i>

I've always thought the second sentence was a sentence fragment, and if I were editing someone else's text, I'd dutifully change the first sentence's period to a comma and combine the two. I think I thought this because I looked at "which" as a conjunction. But "which" is a perfectly good pronoun, and it can be a perfectly good subject of a sentence.
