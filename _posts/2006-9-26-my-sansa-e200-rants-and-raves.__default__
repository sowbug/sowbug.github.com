As you probably guessed from my <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/archives/000271.html">last post</a>, I got a Sansa e260 music player the other day. Here are my thoughts.

<ul><li>Size is just fine. I don't think smaller would do any good.</li>
<li>The screen is pretty nice in spite of its small size. I get a freaky stereoscopic effect when looking at it, though, which goes away if I close one eye.</li>
<li>You have to set the clock yourself. Why can't it do this automatically during a sync?</li>
<li>An alarm clock would have been nice, until you remember there's no speaker.</li>
<li>The media converter software sucks. The video is actually sort of OK, but landscape pictures always get rotated to portrait orientation on the portrait screen, which means they're very small with two big black bands on the top and bottom. Silly. I'd rather have to turn the player sideways than lose so much resolution on an already small screen.</li>
<li>I have to play a song to add it to the "Go List," which is the only playlist you can edit on the device. This means the Go List is useless as a jukebox-style list. I'd like to be able to listen to music and queue up more songs as I browse, but the Sansa won't let you do that. <b>Edit #2 9/27/2006: Close but no cigar, SanDisk. A tip on an online bulletin board suggested a way to add music to the Go List while playing other songs. This seems like the feature I wanted, but it's fatally flawed. If you add to the Go List while simultaneously playing it, the Sansa fails to re-read the list -- it plays the Go List contents as of the moment you originally started it! In order to hear the music you added, you have to restart play of the Go List. Very non-jukebox-like. My criticism stands.</b></li>
<li>The buttons are too hard to press. They're too small and the wheel gets in the way.</li>
<li>The proprietary connector makes me angry. Every other applicable consumer device I own works with a mini-USB plug.</li>
<li>The proprietary connector is especially annoying because none of the e200 accessories that plug into it are available yet. And how about a second USB cable so you can sync at work and at home? Forget about it.</li>
<li>The volume resets to 50% every time you power off the device. Maybe they were trying to limit flash writes for this oft-changed setting. But wow, what a price to pay.</li>
</ul>

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It sounds good, it's small, and the battery life is apparently infinite -- or at least longer than I've gone between charging it.
