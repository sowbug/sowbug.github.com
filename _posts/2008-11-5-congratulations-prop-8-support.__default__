I'm sure you aren't personally a bigot. But yesterday you did vote with the bigots, and yesterday the bigots appear to have prevailed. You and the bigots whose cause you support appear to have won.

This morning I dropped off my son at school. As I was leaving, a group of older kids, maybe eight or nine years old, approached in the opposite direction. As they passed, I overheard one say as he threw his arms in the air, "Please God, make sure every absentee ballot votes no on 8." Another yelled in response, "No on 8!"

I was floored. I pictured myself in the same situation: eight years old in my elementary school, late 1970s, in Santa Cruz County, California. What if I'd yelled the equivalent of "I support equal marriage rights for all, even for gays!" in the middle of my schoolyard? I'd have been beaten to a pulp by the end of the day. In fact, the principal probably would have blamed me for provoking an attack.

It took thirty years to get this far, and last night was a setback. It might take another thirty years before this generation of kids grows up and fixes this civil rights issue.

Thirty years from now, will you be remembered as a bigot?
