This GitHub page is an attempt to find a semi-permanent home for content formerly stored at [sowbug.org](http://www.sowbug.org/) and
[sowbug.com](http://www.sowbug.com). At the moment, both those sites are
mostly still up, but I'm migrating content away from them, generally to here.
I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate these pages, which is
appealing because in theory it should be easy to move to a different
environment in the future if GitHub doesn't work out.
