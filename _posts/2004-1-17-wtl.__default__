I'm having fun this weekend with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1be1eb52-aa96-4685-99a5-4256737781c5">WTL</a>, the Windows Template Library. Feels a little like Java programming, oddly enough. All the code tends to get written in header files, inside the class declaration.

There is a huge amount of sample code on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/wtl/">Code Project</a>, often with helpful articles.
