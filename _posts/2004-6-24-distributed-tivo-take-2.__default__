OK, let me try again.

You know what Tivo is: an appliance that records TV shows as files on a hard drive.

You might know what Bittorrent is: a program that makes file downloads fast by swarming bits of them from your neighbors to you. 

Combine the two and you have a very cool gadget. Plug one end into your home network connection, plug the other into your TV, wait a while, and start watching prerecorded programs.

Key points:

<ul>
<li>You don't need cable anymore.</li>
<li>Depending on your connection speed, you can probably watch a live program delayed by a few seconds, assuming a neighbor is recording and sharing it.</li>
<li>Advertisers can divert their <i>distribution</i> budget into their <i>production</i> budget. In other words, they'll take the money they save on airing commercials and spend it on making commercials that are more enjoyable to watch.</li>
</ul>

I wish someone would do this!
