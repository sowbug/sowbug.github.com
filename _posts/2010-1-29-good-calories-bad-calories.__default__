There are already plenty of summaries and discussions of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033462?ie=UTF8&tag=sowbug-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400033462">Good Calories, Bad Calories</a> by Gary Taubes, so I'll make mine as brief as possible.

Your body wants to be a certain weight (called the "set point"). Normally your body handles all the food you eat by adjusting its metabolism to burn more or less energy, and by adjusting your appetite to make sure you eat more or less in the future.

Refined carbohydrates and sugar confuse this system. They stimulate production of insulin, which forces your body to store blood glucose as fat. Your weight increases, even above your set point.

Because what you ate got stored as fat rather than being used as energy, your body starves. Metabolism slows down, and appetite increases, just as it would in case of real malnourishment.

Eating carbohydrates and sugar puts you in a weird situation. On one hand, your body thinks it's starving, so you're hungry all the time and you're sedentary and listless. But on the other hand, your body is constantly being ordered to stockpile nutrients, so you're piling on fat pounds. And to make matters worse, you might get type-2 diabetes, heart disease, or even cancer (which it turns out seems to thrive on insulin).

Side note: all that research about how dietary fat makes you fat and causes heart disease? Turns out it was misrepresented, misinterpreted, or contradicted by better research.

Conclusion: avoid refined carbs and sugar. Do so and your body will return to its set point. As a bonus, you'll be less likely to get diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.
