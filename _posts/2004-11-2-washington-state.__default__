At this moment, CBS and NBC have both called Washington state for Kerry. But their own data now show that Bush is ahead. Are CBS and NBC going to have to retract their declarations? Maybe they're using exit polls rather than actual precinct reports. <strong><i>Update: Kerry is now well ahead in the Washington state popular vote. No issue here.</i></strong>
