<p>After losing a few too many late-stage tournaments with AA, whether to KK making a set on the flop, or to my opponent's pair on the flop making two pair on the turn, or to insane miracle flushes on the river, I have to say I'm warming up to this starting hand once again after the following:</p>

<pre>
PokerStars No-Limit Hold'em, $0.10 BB (9 handed)

UTG+1 ($10.15)
MP1 ($4.25)
Sowbug ($9.65)
MP3 ($8.50)
CO ($10.10)
Button ($3.85)
SB ($8.65)
BB ($3.35)
UTG ($23.60)

Preflop: Sowbug is MP2 with Ah, Ad.    
1 fold, UTG+1 raises to $0.30, 1 fold, Sowbug raises to $0.60,
5 folds, UTG+1 calls $0.30.

Flop: ($1.35) Jh, As, Qd (2 players)
UTG+1 checks, Sowbug checks.

Turn: ($1.35) Qs (2 players)
UTG+1 bets $0.75, Sowbug calls $0.75.

River: ($2.85) 2h (2 players)
UTG+1 bets $1, Sowbug raises to $3, UTG+1 raises to $8.80,
Sowbug calls $5.30 (All-In).

Final Pot: $19.95

Results below:  
UTG+1 has Qc Ac (full house, queens full of aces).  
Sowbug has Ah Ad (full house, aces full of queens).  
Outcome: Sowbug wins $19.45. UTG+1 wins $0.50.
