Step 1. Create a new file called stdafx.cpp.
Step 2. In that file, add one line: <code>#include &lt;stdafx.h&gt;</code>
Step 3. Debug for many, many hours.
Step 4. Change stdafx.cpp to this: <code>#include "stdafx.h"</code>. Note that the compiler now stops assuming you meant the stdafx.h buried deep inside the MFC source.
Step 5. Go home and have a drink.
