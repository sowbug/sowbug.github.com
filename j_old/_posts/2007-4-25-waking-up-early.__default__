I've been trying to wake up at 5:00 every morning. I have a couple early-morning commitments each week and it's been too painful to adjust my schedule just for those days, so I decided to try to standardize on the same time every morning. (<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">Obligatory link on this topic</a>.) Given my low success rate so far, I am not qualified to give advice, but that hasn't stopped me in the past, so here goes.

I have an alarm clock that lets me set two different alarms. I set one for 5:00 and the second for 5:01. I also have the clock on the other side of the room so I have to get up to shut it off. This means that I spend at least 60 seconds standing next to the alarm clock waiting for the second alarm to go off, and as long as I don't talk myself out of waking up and go right back to bed, then I stay up.
