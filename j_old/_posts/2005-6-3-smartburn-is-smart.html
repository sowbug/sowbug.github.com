<p>This past weekend I was burning a DVD, and 
about halfway through I accidentally dropped something on the 
keyboard's sleep button. The CPU fan obediently spun down and 
the monitor promptly switched off. Sigh. I reached for a new 
DVD blank and prepared to throw away the now-ruined one in the 
drive. Imagine my amazement when I woke up the computer, it 
resumed burning, and verification succeeded!</p><p>We've come a 
long way since 1996, when moving the cursor over the wrong 
part of the desktop would kill a burn.</p>
