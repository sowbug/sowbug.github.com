Loyal Readers,

I wrote a 99-cent casual iPhone game called <a href="http://bit.ly/a2b6Qo">Teragati</a>, and last night it was approved for sale in the App Store! Please head on over there and <a href="http://bit.ly/a2b6Qo">buy it now</a>. It's just 99 cents, it takes a few moments to learn, and typical games last only about a minute. It's a perfect way to spend time waiting in an ATM line.

If you like the game, please <a href="http://bit.ly/a2b6Qo">rate it</a> in the App Store (5 stars, please!) and write a brief review. If you don't have an iPhone, please tell someone who does.

Thanks!
