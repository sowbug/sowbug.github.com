My Thinkpad T41p is a fine laptop, but for some really weird reason IBM forgot to put on the Windows key and the Application (a.k.a. Context) key. Add this to your registry to convert the two useless buttons next to the arrow keys (I think they were page-back and page-forward) to the Windows and Context keys:

<code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,\
00,5b,e0,6a,e0,5d,e0,69,e0,00,00,00,00</code>

Then restart your computer and it should work.
