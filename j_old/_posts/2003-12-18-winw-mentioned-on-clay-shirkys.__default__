Wow, <a title="Shirky: The RIAA Succeeds Where the Cypherpunks Failed" href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/riaa_encryption.html">Clay Shirky mentioned WINW</a>! I was wondering why the hits on winw.org suddenly went from dozens to thousands.

He says "In response to the RIAA's suits, users who want to share music files are adopting tools like WINW and BadBlue, that allow them to create encrypted spaces where they can share files and converse with one another." Well, that's true except for the word "are" -- replace it with "will, if Mike ever finishes his project, be" -- and it's a little closer to the true state of affairs.
