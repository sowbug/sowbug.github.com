<h2>Motivation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Inexpensive: I don't want to spend more than
    $700.</li>
  <li>Excellent performance: it's going to be
    mostly just a web server, rather than a compute server, so the requirements
    are fairly low.</li>
  <li>High-quality components: all name-brand.</li>
  <li>Not expandable. The odds of being able to
    upgrade economically are probably very small, so I'm not willing to spend
    extra for expandability in the future.</li>

  <li>Something I'd be proud to have built (no
    bolt cutters, duct tape, or homemade moving parts).</li>

<h2>Stuff I learned while building this server</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Intel <a href="http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/ea2/index.htm">D815EEA2LU</a>
    seems like a perfect board for a rackmount server, but it doesn't fit in a
    1U case. The audio riser is too high.</li>

  <li>I bought the retail version of the Celeron
    because I wanted a fan with it, but the fan doesn't fit in a 1U case. So
    that was a waste of a couple of dollars.</li>
  <li>It turns out that the Celeron 1.2GHz has an
    &quot;integrated heat spreader&quot; that plays more nicely with this
    particular board's built-in heat sink. Oh well.</li>
  <li>I didn't bother with a floppy drive. I will
    probably regret it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://pricewatch.com">Pricewatch</a>
    is pretty cool, but it doesn't list every company in the world, so it still
    pays to do a search or two on <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>.</li>

  <li>There are a couple of barebones 1U servers
    out there by well-known manufacturers, such as the Intel ISP1100 (<a href="http://microx-press.com/templates/micro/product.asp?sid=4560ECB0724A47C69BBFBCDE7615A3FD&amp;prodid=MBRIN409">here</a>
    is one for sale) and the <a href="http://supermicro.com/PRODUCT/SUPERServer/SUPER%20SERVER%205010E%20Server.htm">Supermicro
    5010E</a>, but they're just plain more expensive than building it yourself.
    I looked at the 5010E at <a href="http://frys.com">Fry's Electronics </a>and
    it didn't give me an impression of being high quality -- the stickers were
    put on crooked and it looked like it was all plastic.</li>
</ul>
