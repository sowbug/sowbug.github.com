This tarball</a> contains the Linkstation telnet binary and a 
script that inserts the binary into a Linkstation 1.4x 
firmware installer and configures inetd to run telnetd at 
system startup. Read the instructions at the top of the shell 
script. I haven't actually tested to see if this works, but if 
it doesn't it shouldn't take much more effort to fix it.<p>
This approach saves bandwidth compared to downloading a new 37 
megabyte installer for each tiny change.
