<p>The best part of
<a href="http://www.dvdshrink.org/">
DVD Shrink</a> is that it scrubs your DVDs of "prohibited user 
operation," or "PUOP" flags. You know, the ones that 
effectively add 30 seconds to the boot time of your DVD player 
by putting that little stop sign up in the corner when you try 
to fast forward through the really unamazing CG animation 
sequence before the main menu.<p>I'm fascinated that DVD 
manufacturers (a) choose to punish the 99.9999999% of DVD 
viewers who are <b>not</b> members of counterfeiting rings by 
forcing them to watch some gobbledygook about Interpol and 
rebroadcasting every single time they pop a movie in their 
player, and (b) apparently think that the other 0.0000001% of 
viewers -- the target audience of the PUOP warnings -- will 
actually realize the error of their ways and leave their 
bootlegging careers because the DVD they're copying told them 
to. (There's also an possibility (c), which is that DVD 
manufacturers figure we're all on the verge of becoming 
copyright criminals and need reeducation through Intellectual 
Property Boot Camp Class before being allowed to watch the 
movie we bought.)</p>
<p>Never mind the completely pointless PUOP sequences, such as 
the ones on <i>The Simpsons</i> DVDs that spend 8 seconds of 
dead air telling us that the opinions of commentators are 
their own and not those of the publisher. Who in the marketing 
department decided that needed to be a PUOP?</p>
<p>Try DVD Shrink. You'll find that it's worth spending 30 
cents on a DVD blank for DVDs you watch frequently just to get 
rid of the warnings. And guess what -- it's 100% legal to do 
so! (At least, as long as legislation

like this</a> doesn't take effect.)
