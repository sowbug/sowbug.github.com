<p>I came across the following ominous search term in my webserver logs:<pre>michael tsao death</pre></p><p>Curious about what the world had to say about such an idea, I typed the same search term into Google and was saddened to see that indeed, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/industries/retailing_restaurants/restaurants/2005/07/25/columbus_daily7.html">Michael Tsao had died</a>.</p><p>Long ago, back in the days when you could email people you found on the web and they'd actually reply, I wrote to the president of Kahiki Foods. I proudly announced that I, too, was a Michael Tsao, and told him a bit about myself. He promptly wrote back, saying that his son was also in the tech industry, and that he wished me well.</p><p>That was the extent of my relationship with this Michael Tsao. But even from my brief contact with him, I know he was a decent guy, and I'm sorry that he's gone.</p>
