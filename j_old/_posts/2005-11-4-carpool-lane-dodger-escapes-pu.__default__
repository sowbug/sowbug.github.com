<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/04/MNGSRFJ6LS5.DTL">As reported elsewhere</a>, a guy got fined $351 for having a fake person in his car's passenger seat so that he had less of a chance of getting caught driving in the carpool lane.

The article makes it seem like he got caught, but I think he actually got off scot-free. The fine for driving solo in the carpool lane is $351. Technically, that's all this guy was doing, so technically, that's all he should be fined for. But doesn't it seem like he was doing something much worse?

Moreover, if the fine for driving alone in the carpool lane is the same as the fine driving in the carpool lane with a device designed solely to trick law enforcement, then rationally, every carpool violator should always carry a dummy in their car with them.
