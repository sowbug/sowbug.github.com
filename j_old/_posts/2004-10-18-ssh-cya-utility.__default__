More than once I've added an authorized key to my SSH configuration and logged out without setting the permissions back again. My login passwords are all very long and randomly generated, I generally don't use them, and I certainly haven't memorized them. This makes it quite inconvenient to recover from accidentally disabling public-key logins. So I put this in ~/.bash_logout today:

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Seems to work fine. I haven't thought of a reason why this is a bad idea, other than it promotes forgetfulness.
