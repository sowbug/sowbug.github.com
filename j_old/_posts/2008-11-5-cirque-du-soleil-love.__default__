Mary and I saw <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/love/intro/">this</a> a couple weeks ago. It was marvelous! Each seat had a set of speakers in it, so the sound was immersive. Likewise, the theater itself was designed to surround much of the audience, meaning that I could see action all around me. HDTV looks like a small stained-glass window in comparison.

Add in all the usual Cirque stuff (real live humans twisted into impossible positions while flying through the air), and it was quite a show. See it!
