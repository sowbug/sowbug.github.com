An earthquake of magnitude 5.6 shook us yesterday evening. Actions taken by my family:

Mike: looks up from studying. Yells "Earthquake!" into family room. Returns to studying.
Mary: runs outside.
Thomas: no visible reaction.
Emily: exclaims "We should get under a table!" and starts pulling Thomas with her.

I'd say Emily wins this round.
