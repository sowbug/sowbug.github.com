I recently <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sowbug/status/26183146389">tweeted</a> about my displeasure with the long time it takes between the rental decision and actually getting to watch anything on the new Apple TV. My comparison was Netflix streaming (which is absolutely amazing and unbelievable that it's only $9/month).

But I thought a little more about it and realized that Apple is making a big deal about HD quality. If that's the promise, then they have to stick to it; they can't ratchet down to lower video quality or pause for 30 seconds to let the buffer catch up, because that would ruin the  promised viewing experience. It's the usual tradeoff as in most projects. Cheap, fast, good: pick two. Apple chose cheap and good. Netflix chose cheap and fast.

So I retract my disappointment about the poor streaming experience, but I replace it with a different disappointment: that Apple TV probably can't replace both cable and Netflix. Apple TV requires planning ahead in exchange for a guaranteed viewing experience. Netflix and cable are good for watching something, anything, when I'm bored. Apple TV could replace my DVD player and my TiVo for the few programs I record (Hell's Kitchen, Master Chef, The Simpsons, Family Guy). But as long as Apple picks good over fast, it can't yet replace cable.
