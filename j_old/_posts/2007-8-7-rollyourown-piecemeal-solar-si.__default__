I'll be going camping soon in a sunny place, and was thinking of using this trip as an excuse to start on a long-term project of building my own grid-tie PV (photovoltaic) solar system at home. I'm asking you, person who probably arrived here via a search engine, whether this is a workable idea.

Allow me to play the part of Basil Exposition for a moment: <em>"As you may know, gentle reader, grid-tie systems are connected to the electricity grid, which generally means that they supplement a home's electricity, rather than being the sole source of it. A typical system consists of some PV panels that convert solar energy to DC electricity, an inverter that both converts the solar DC power to AC and connects the system to the power grid, and optionally a charge controller that delivers power to deep-cycle batteries, which store excess power for use at night time."</em>

For the camping trip, the basic strategy is to buy one of each part of the system that can be bought piecemeal, and then buy inexpensive, relatively throwaway versions of parts that are expensive in a full-blown system. I'd buy one 120-watt panel (about $600) and a cheap charge controller (about $50). I'd then use a couple deep-cycle batteries and a little inverter that I already own. On the trip I'd use this power to charge various battery-powered devices, such as a laptop computer. (We'll ignore the annoyance that I feel knowing that 12-volt DC gets converted to 120-volt AC and then back down again to around 12 volts to charge batteries, no doubt losing at least 40% power in the process.)

On my return, I'd put the panel on the roof of my house and try connecting my desktop computer to it (via a UPS so I get a warning if power's low). I use that computer for perhaps a few hours a day so it should work.

Eventually, after research, and hopefully your feedback, I'd shell out money for a real grid-tie inverter (at least a couple thousand dollars) and charge controller (also thousands of dollars), and then add a few more panels and batteries. If the efficiency worked out, then I'd scale up the system -- having already bought inverter and charge controller capacity to handle the extra power.

The alternative is just coughing up $40,000 and having someone come in and install a complete system this weekend on my roof.

Advantages of the roll-your-own approach? It's an interesting hobby project; it commits less capital up front. To the extent that PV panels come down in price as technological advances occur, I get the benefit of lower prices in the future.

Disadvantages? It might fail because I don't know what I'm doing; I get the worst possible return on the large components until I fully utilize their capacity.

What do you think? Silly idea?
