This isn't a great picture because of the glossy screen. I was sitting in my local coffeeshop working this morning, and had to turn down the screen brightness on my laptop because I was getting low on batteries. I noticed a bright area right in the middle of the screen, which persisted even when I turned off the screen backlight entirely. It wasn't a reflection.

Can you figure out what it was? (I eventually did.)
