Is there a standard way for Python apps to pick up stuff from well-known locations on a Linux machine? In Java we follow this idiom:




Here's a problem and the solution I used. Your suggestions for better solutions would be quite appreciated.

I have a Python/Django web app. It gets worked on by individual developers on their workstations. They check their changes into Subversion. The code is then rolled out to a development server. If that's successful, it's promoted to a staging server. Finally, it gets out to production.

We use a configuration-management system, Puppet, to distribute and control each environment's configurations.
