This is how to put playlists on the Sansa e260 MP3 player (part of the e200 series) using an application other than Windows Media Player, such as <a href="http://www.winamp.com">Winamp</a>, without having to switch from MTP to the less convenient MSC mode. I won't go into the reasons why you'd want to do this; if you've ever used WMP, the reasons are plain as day.

Some background why these instructions are even necessary: the e260 seems to have a bug with playlists. You can add .pla files to \PLAYLISTS, but no matter how correctly you've formatted them, they won't show up in the Sansa UI. The device seems to need a kick in the head to tell it to re-read the files in \PLAYLISTS. These instructions tell you how to conveniently deliver that kick.

Note that my e260 has firmware 01.01.11A, and these instructions work with Winamp 5.24 full version (full is the free version that supports WMA).

First, start up Winamp and add your songs to its library. You've probably already done this.

Next, create a playlist. Call it "Exercise" for this example. Drag a few songs from your library to it.

Next, connect your e260 in MTP mode. It should show up after a few seconds under the "Portables" item in the Winamp hierarchy. Right-click the Exercise playlist and send to your e260. Wait for the playlist and songs to sync, then disconnect your device.

(Optional) go to your e260's playlists and confirm that Exercise didn't show up. If you do see it, then you probably have a future version of the firmware that doesn't have this problem.

Here's the kick. Turn the e260 off by holding down the power button for a couple seconds until you see "GOODBYE." Release the power button. Switch the lock slider to the locked position. Press the power button and keep holding it down. The blue wheel light will come on, and then you'll see the SanDisk logo. Then the screen will go black and you'll see

<pre>Key LOCKED
System shutdown</pre>

Once you see that message, you can let go of the power button. Flip the lock slider to the unlocked position and press the power button again. Now navigate back to your playlists and you should see Exercise!

Fortunately you don't have to go through these hoops with every sync. You can freely edit existing playlists and add/remove music; these actions appear to work fine. This hack is necessary only to get new playlists to show up.

SanDisk, please fix this bug!
