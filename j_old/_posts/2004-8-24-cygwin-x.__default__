A few weeks ago a coworker introduced me to <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin's X server</a>. This was in connection with my gripe that there is no dual-DVI USB KVM currently available that doesn't look like an <a href="http://www.machine-room.org/images/pictures/hires/160/16/Altair_8800_Unit_2.jpg">Altair 8080</a>. 
Cygwin X works well enough that I no longer have to have an extra monitor and keyboard on my desk for my Linux box. I just ssh -Y to it in a Cygwin xterm, and run xemacs all day long.

I haven't yet been successful running over anything but a LAN. I don't think it's a bandwidth issue, because X windows never come up.
