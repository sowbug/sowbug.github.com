<p>Yesterday on the XM Radio station
<a href="http://www.xmradio.com/programming/channel_page.jsp?ch=83">
Chrome</a> I heard the long version of Gloria Gaynor's disco 
anthem <i>I Will Survive</i> for the first time. It's quite 
impressive. The version you're probably used to hearing is 
about three minutes long. But the long version is basically 
her singing the whole song all over again. Toward the end the 
drummer starts doing some really funky improvisations, like 
he's had an itch for a while and needs to scratch without 
missing any beats.
