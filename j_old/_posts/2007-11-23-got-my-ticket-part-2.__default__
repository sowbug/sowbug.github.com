These are the topics I hope to cover in the future:

<ul>
	<li>My excellent CFI (certificated flight instructor), <a href="http://jeffz.org/">Jeff Zacharias</a></li>
	<li>Why I started flight training to begin with, and why most of those reasons turned out to be wrong</li>
	<li>The time I almost killed Jeff</li>
	<li>The other time I almost killed Jeff</li>
	<li>My theory why many students stop flight training midway through</li>
	<li>How to complete flight training on a budget (subtitled "Everything that I wish I'd done, in hindsight")</li>
	<li>Capsule reviews of various aviation products and services</li>
</ul>

Some of these posts are already written, but I deferred publication until now. The reason I kept my flight training fairly quiet while it was in progress is because I've noticed that the topic of pilot training tends to dominate all conversation with friends and family, partly because it's genuinely interesting, but mostly because the experience is immersive. It's hard for someone in the midst of becoming a pilot to avoid turning all possible discussion toward the topic of aviation. Now that the most intense part is past, I hope I can start discussing it without becoming too much of a bore. :)
