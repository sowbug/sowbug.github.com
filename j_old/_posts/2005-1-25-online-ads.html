This article</a> spurred me to write about something that's 
bugged me for a while. Why don't ad agencies host MPEGs of all 
the TV commercials they've produced? Or even better, why don't 
advertisers host their commercials online? Why wouldn't they 
want to distribute commercials to people who actually want to 
watch them?<p>I have seen a few archives of ads, but they 
don't cover everything, and they often seem to be low-quality 
encodings off a TV tuner.</p>
<p>There's a Denny's ad of a chicken dancing on a fence from 
the mid 1990s that I'd love to watch again. Or heck, any Old 
Navy ad with pre-supermodel-era Molly Sims in it (hi Mary! 
I'll just go ahead and make up my bed on the couch tonight).</p>
<p>I'm sure there's some sinister force at work I know nothing 
about that means it's legally, economically, and politically 
impossible to easily choose to watch commercials that aren't 
broadcast on TV. It can't be technological reasons, especially 
if BitTorrent makes hosting costs practically nonexistent.
