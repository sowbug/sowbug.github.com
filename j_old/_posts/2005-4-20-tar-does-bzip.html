<p>This is embarrassing. For years I've 
extracted .tar.bz2 files by the two-step &quot;bunzip foo.tar.bz2 
&amp;&amp; tar xf foo.tar&quot; method, but it was annoying that tar didn't 
know what to do with .bz2 archives and thus wasn't as 
convenient as &quot;tar xzf foo.tar.gz.&quot; Well, last night I 
discovered tar's -j option, which does the same thing for 
bzipped archives as -z does for gzipped archives. Hooray!
