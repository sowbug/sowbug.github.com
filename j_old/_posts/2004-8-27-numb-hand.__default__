Once in the early 1990s I fell asleep on my hand and it went numb for days. I had been having some carpal tunnel problems in the preceding weeks. I'm sure that had something to do with it. Maybe my brain had gotten used to tuning out of the pain so it ignored my hand screaming that it was being starved of oxygen.

The experience was awful. I couldn't make a fist; I couldn't write; I could hardly type. I remember having to sign a couple documents during that time. They looked like I was writing with my foot. Fortunately before I got around to seeing a doctor about it, it had cleared up.
