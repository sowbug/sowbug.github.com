<p>What do you usually do when you need to set text in a Windows control? You do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SetWindowText()</li>
  <li>SetDlgItemText()</li>
  <li>SendMessage(WM_SETTEXT)</li>
  <li>SendMessage(WM_SETTEXTEX)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's tempting to do the same for a Rich Edit control, and sure enough, this 
will work on almost all versions of Windows.</p> 
<p>On early '98 systems, however, it 
won't always work. In cases where it doesn't, it either displays gobbledygook, 
does nothing, or crashes -- pretty easy for this to slip by QA. Moreover, after 
looking into the MSDN documentation on the subject, I don't actually see any 
guarantee that simply setting text on a Rich Edit control will work on <i>any</i> 
version of Windows.</p>
<p>Instead, you must stream text into these controls. Doing so is a little more 
cumbersome than a single function call, but it's simple boilerplate code. 
Here is an example of how to do it:</p>
<pre>static DWORD CALLBACK editStreamCallback(DWORD_PTR dwCookie,
                                         LPBYTE pbBuff,
                                         LONG cb,
                                         LONG *pcb)
{
    esstruct *ess = (esstruct *)dwCookie;
    if (NULL != ess) {
        *pcb = cb;
        if (*pcb &gt; ess-&gt;nSize) {
            *pcb = ess-&gt;nSize;
        }
        if (*pcb &gt; 0) {
            memcpy(pbBuff, ess-&gt;lpText, *pcb);
            ess-&gt;lpText += *pcb;
            ess-&gt;nSize -= *pcb;
        }
        return 0;
    }
    return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER;
}

void SetTextForMyControl(LPTSTR *text)
{
    esstruct ess;
    EDITSTREAM es;

    ess.lpText = text;
    ess.nSize = (text-&gt;get_Length()) * sizeof(TCHAR);

    es.dwCookie = (DWORD_PTR)&amp;ess;
    es.dwError = 0;
    es.pfnCallback = editStreamCallback;

    SendMessage(GetDlgItem(hwnd, IDC_MYCONTROL),
        EM_STREAMIN,
        (WPARAM)(SF_TEXT /* optional: | SF_UNICODE*/),
        (LPARAM)&amp;es);
}</pre>
<p>This performs extremely reliably on all Windows systems I have tested. I 
strongly recommend that you use it whenever you want to set text on a Rich Edit 
control.</p>
