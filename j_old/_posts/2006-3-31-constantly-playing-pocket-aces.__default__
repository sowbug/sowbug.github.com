How many people must be in a room with you before there's a better-than-50% chance that at least one of them shares your birthday? (Same month and day, not necessarily same year.) Most people would answer "uh... I guess 183 because that's more than half the number of days in a year." It turns out that, according to the so-called "birthday paradox," the answer is actually only 23. The reason is that people forget to include the chance that <i>all</i> of you share the same birthday, or that <i>all but one</i> of you were born on the same day, and so on. Although all those chances seem small, they add up to a lot, and that's why you need so few people in the room before it's likely you'll find at least one.

A fun application of this principle tells us <i>how many online poker tables you must play at the same time to have a greater-than-50% chance of always playing at least one pocket-aces starting hand at any given moment.</i> The chance of being dealt pocket aces is 1:220, or one out of every 221 hands. So you can think of this as each hand being a birthday in a year of 221 days. The math works out to be this:

<ul>
<li>2 tables: 0.45%</li>
<li>3 tables: 1.35%</li>
<li>4 tables: 2.69%</li>
<li>5 tables: 4.45%</li>
<li>6 tables: 6.62%</li>
<li>7 tables: 9.15%</li>
<li>8 tables: 12.03%</li>
<li>9 tables: 15.21%</li>
<li>10 tables: 18.67%</li>
<li>11 tables: 22.35%</li>
<li>12 tables: 26.21%</li>
<li>13 tables: 30.22%</li>
<li>14 tables: 34.32%</li>
<li>15 tables: 38.48%</li>
<li>16 tables: 42.66%</li>
<li>17 tables: 46.81%</li>
<li><strong><font color="#009900">18 tables: 50.90%</font></strong></li>
<li>19 tables: 54.90%</li>
<li>20 tables: 58.78%</li>
<li>21 tables: 62.51%</li>
<li>22 tables: 66.07%</li>
<li>23 tables: 69.45%</li>
<li>24 tables: 72.63%</li>
<li>25 tables: 75.60%</li>
<li>26 tables: 78.36%</li>
<li>27 tables: 80.91%</li>
<li>28 tables: 83.24%</li>
<li>29 tables: 85.36%</li>
<li>30 tables: 87.28%</li>
</ul>

So there you have it: play 18 tables simultaneously, and there will be a 50% chance that you'll be playing pocket aces at any given time. Play 30 tables if you want to be guaranteed* to be doing so.

*"Guaranteed" defined as "better than the chances of aces over the hammer," because we know AA <i>always</i> beats 72o.
