The other day I asked my daughter, who turned 4 a few weeks ago, what 1 + 1 was. She promptly replied "Two!!!" This surprised me because I wasn't even sure she knew what "plus" meant. But she also knew what 2 + 2 was, and we made it through all the combinations up to 2 + 5 before I stopped. I'm always surprised when my kids learn new words or say things in a conversationally adult way, but this new skill shocked me. I have no idea whether she's been practicing at school, or whether at a certain age kids suddenly know how to do arithmetic. Either way, pretty cool!
