We recently replaced our home cordless phone with the Siemens <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Siemens-Gigaset-Cordless-Landline-S675IP/dp/B002DEMELY/?tag=sowbug-20">Gigaset S675IP</a>, which is a cordless phone/answering machine combo that has a key new feature: it will act as an ATA for up to six SIP accounts. In plain English, this means we can easily make phone calls over the internet using free providers like <a href="http://www.gizmo5.com/">Gizmo</a> and <a href="http://www.sipgate.com/">sipgate</a>. (In our case, the motivation for getting a VOIP-capable device wasn't so much free calls as the ability to easily add extra phone lines for our business and the kids.) I'm hoping the Siemens folks read blogs, because here are some feature requests:

<ul>
	<li>I'd like the handset to have a unique ring per SIP account. This way we can tell whether the call is coming in on my work line, our home line, the kids' line, etc. My suspicion is that the DECT standard doesn't allow this, because it seems like an obvious and useful feature that wouldn't have been overlooked.</li>
     <li>Either let me add new ringtones or include some standard, ordinary ringtones. All the ones included on the S67H handset are either musical sequences or incredibly shrill alert-type sounds. How about just a conventional ringing-bell sound?</li>
     <li>Please fix the screensaver-eating-the-first-keystroke bug that Michael Graves described in his remarkably comprehensive <a href="http://www.mgraves.org/voip/2009/07/review-the-gigaset-a580ip-sipdect-cordless-phone-system/">A580 review</a>.</li>
     <li>Please let me specify whether the address book displays Last, First or First, Last.</li>
</ul>

Capsule review: the phone system is very good. It does everything it promises. Audio quality is great, range is excellent, SIP account setup is reasonably easy, and battery life appears to be a non-issue. I wish the handset UI were faster -- it suffers from too-long pauses after keystrokes, like so many portable electronics these days -- but other than that, I'm satisfied with the purchase.
