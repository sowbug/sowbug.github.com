<form mt:asset-id="3" contenteditable="false" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img alt="tinyp2p screenshot" src="/assets/img/screenshot.jpeg" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="269" width="330"></form> <div>I wrote this to test asynchronous socket I/O notifications on Windows. It turned out to be a nice self-contained project, so here it is, with source. MIT license. Requires Visual Studio .NET to build. It should be easy to figure out how to build it on earlier versions of Visual Studio.<br><br>Have fun. <a href="assets/zip/tinyp2p.zip">tinyp2p.zip</a></div><div><br></div>
