      Defends Title At Laguna Seca</FONT></B><FONT size=2> 
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>MONTEREY (AvantNews) - Local squid favorite, 
      heavyweight bruiser, and 1980s retro-sportbike devotee Andy Van Fossen met 
      fans' expectations at world-renowned Laguna Seca Raceway last Thursday as 
      he managed a low-speed, single-vehicle crash in the paddock on his Honda 
      CBR-1000 Hurricane motorcycle.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Of the dozens of eyewitnesses recounting the 
      incident to reporters, few agreed on the exact circumstances. "I think he 
      highsided it, but at two miles an hour what's the difference?" queried 
      Team Yamaha Retail rider David Johnson. "He just fell off," commented 
      onlooker and Honda Sport Tourer Daniel Pifko. Added Michael "Hi-Viz" Tsao, 
      "The instructor said to hit the brakes hard, but I don't remember anyone 
      saying throw yourself off the damn bike."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>An accident reconstruction expert on the scene was 
      unable to shed further light on Van Fossen's separation from his bike. 
      "All I can say for sure is that this motorcycle has been through a lot," 
      said AFM 650 Twins Champ Dan Argano. "Judging from the extensive recent 
      damage to the bike, my best guess is Andy hit a deer or possibly a 
      California Gray Whale in the pit area. But how could such a big animal 
      make it across the track and into the paddock without being seen by 
      anyone?"</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Thursday's turn of events further increases Van 
      Fossen's commanding lead in the 2000 AvantGo Motorcycle Get-Off 
      Championship standings. With 79 points, Van Fossen easily outpaces 
      second-place Tsao, who currently holds a total of one point for his 
      February parking lot fallover.</FONT></P></FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana><B>AvantGo Employees Humiliated By Irrefutable Truth of 
      Videotape</B><FONT size=2> 
      <P>MONTEREY (AvantNews) - After nearly a full day of telling their 
      coworkers high-speed knee-draggin', shit-kickin', death-defyin' stories of 
      the previous day at Laguna Seca Raceway, certain AvantGo employees were 
      shocked and silenced into abject humility after viewing an 
      eight-millimeter Sony Handycam videotape of their track day.</P>
      <P>Andy Van Fossen, Michael Tsao, David Johnson, and Daniel Pifko huddled 
      quietly in AvantTheater and noted the wussiness 
      of their straightaway speeds, their very-nearly-off-perpendicular lean 
      angles through turn 2, the approximately two-foot distance between knee 
      and pavement through turn 11, and the wide, sweeping scenic route taken 
      through the Corkscrew and Rainey Curve.</P>
      <P>The riders have declined to comment further on the 
      videotape.&nbsp;</P></FONT></FONT></TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width="55%"><FONT face=Verdana><B>Rift in Space-Time 
      Continuum Captures, Releases AvantGo Employees</B></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>MARINA, CALIFORNIA (AvantNews) - Dr. Emmett 
      "Doc" L. Brown's worst fears were realized Wednesday when the very fabric 
      of space and time ripped and swallowed up several AvantGo employees, only 
      to release them hours later, apparently unharmed and without any known 
      Karmic imbalance.</FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2>The strange chain of events began when Mike Tsao and Andy 
      Van Fossen easily made several normally impossible left turns into traffic 
      while driving Tom Whittaker's truck that was towing a rickety garden cart. 
      "It was just like the Red Sea parted in front of us. I mean, if you 
      believe in that Bible stuff," said Van Fossen. "And it happened on Ralston 
      Avenue, not in Egypt. And I don't think they had U-Haul 2,000 years 
      ago."</FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2>Further weirdness ensued as Tsao, Van Fossen, Daniel 
      Pifko, David Johnson, and Johnson's friends Mike and Jason entered a bar 
      that was evidently teleported from the late-1980s David Lynch television 
      series <I>Twin Peaks</I>. Tsao disappeared into a neighboring cardroom, 
      only to reappear half an hour later carrying $94.00, twenty dollars' worth 
      of food stamps, most of a loaf of Velveeta, an unopened "Value-Pak" of 
      Huggies diapers, and </FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>a lawn 
      gnome</FONT><FONT size=2>. Several unidentified patrons of the bar marked 
      his return with a horrifying karaoke medley of Queen's <I>Bohemian 
      Rhapsody</I>, Lionel Ritchie's <I>Hello</I>, and countless Elton John 
      works.</FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2>It was not until pointed investigation by Pifko that the 
      group confirmed that it was anywhere but on Planet Earth </FONT><FONT 
      face=Verdana size=2>in the current Universe</FONT><FONT size=2>. Pifko 
      engaged the drunkest and wobbliest barfly in conversation only to learn 
      that the individual, one Rob Scott, was in fact a member of the SyncML 
      team at IBM Corporation, specifically in charge of SyncML's relationship 
      with the IBM DB2 Anywhere project. The two exchanged contact information, 
      and Scott expressed interest in an employment position at AvantGo. Shortly 
      thereafter Pifko's head suddenly exploded.</FONT>
      <P><FONT size=2>At approximately 1:00 a.m. the rift in the Universe closed 
      and expelled the group into the local Denny's restaurant, where they 
      enjoyed a completely typical, boisterous, post-drinking Multiple Slam 
      meal. No evidence of the earlier oddities manifested itself with the 
      exception of the recovering Pifko, who extracted two perfectly round 
      over-easy egg yolks from his entree and ate them last.
