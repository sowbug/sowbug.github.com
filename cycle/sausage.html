<h2 align="center"><font face="Courier New">Song Of the Sausage Creature</font></h2>
<h3 align="center"><font face="Courier New">by Hunter S. Thompson</font></h3>
<p><font face="Courier New">There are some things nobody needs in this world,
and a bright red, hunchback, warp-speed 900cc café racer is one of them -- but
I want one anyway, and on some days I actually believe I need one. That is why
they are dangerous.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Everybody has fast motorcycles these days. Some
people go 150 miles an hour on two-lane blacktop roads, but not often. There are
too many oncoming trucks and too many radar cops and too many stupid animals in
the way. You have to be a little crazy to ride these super-torque high-speed
crotch rockets anywhere except a racetrack -- and even there, they will scare
the whimpering shit out of you.... There is, after all, not a pig's eye worth of
difference between going head-on into a Peterbilt or sideways into the
bleachers. On some days you get what you want, and on others, you get what you
need.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">When Cycle World called me to ask if I would
road-test the new Harley Road King, I got uppity and said I'd rather have a
Ducati superbike. It seemed like a chic decision at the time, and my friends on
the superbike circuit got very excited. &quot;Hot damn,&quot; they said,
&quot;We will take it to the track and blow the bastards away.&quot;</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Courier New">&quot;Balls,&quot; I said. &quot;Never mind the
track. The track is for punks. We are Road People. We are Café Racers.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">The Café Racer is a different breed, and we have
our own situations. Pure speed in sixth gear on a 5,000-foot straightaway is one
thing, but pure speed in third gear on a gravel-strewn downhill S-turn is quite
another.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">But we like it. A thoroughbred Café Racer will ride
all night through a fog storm in freeway traffic to put himself into what
somebody told him was the ugliest and tightest decreasing-radius turn since
Genghis Khan invented the corkscrew.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Café Racing is mainly a matter of taste. It is an
atavistic mentality, a peculiar mix of low style, high speed, pure dumbness, and
overweening commitment to the Café Life and all its dangerous pleasures.... I
am a Café Racer myself, on some days -- and many nights for that matter -- and
it is one of my finest addictions....</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">I am not without scars on my brain and my body, but
I can live with them. I still feel a shudder in my spine every time I see a
Vincent Black Shadow, or when I walk into a public restroom and hear crippled
men whispering about the terrifying Kawasaki Triple.... I have visions of
compound femur fractures and large black men in white hospital suits holding me
down on a gurney while a nurse called &quot;Bess&quot; sews the flaps of my
scalp together with a stitching drill.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Ho, ho. Thank God for these flashbacks. The brain is
such a wonderful instrument (until God sinks his teeth into it). Some people
hear Tiny Tim singing when they go under, and others hear the song of the
Sausage Creature.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">When the Ducati turned up in my driveway, nobody
knew what to do with it. I was in New York, covering a polo tournament, and
people had threatened my life. My lawyer said I should give myself up and enroll
in the Federal Witness Protection Program. Other people said it had something to
do with the polo crowd.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">The motorcycle business was the last straw. It had
to be the work of my enemies, or people who wanted to hurt me. It was the vilest
kind of bait, and they knew I would go for it.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Of course. You want to cripple the bastard? Send him
a 130-mph café racer. And include some license plates, so he'll think it's a
streetbike. He's queer for anything fast.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Which is true. I have been a connoisseur of fast
motorcycles all my life. I bought a brand-new 650 BSA Lightning when it was
billed as &quot;the fastest motorcycle ever tested by Hot Rod magazine.&quot; I
have ridden a 500-pound Vincent through traffic on the Ventura Freeway with
burning oil on my legs and run the Kawa 750 triple through Beverly Hills at
night with a head full of acid.... I have ridden with Sonny Barger and smoked
weed in biker bars with Jack Nicholson, Grace Slick, Ron Zigler, and my infamous
old friend, Ken Kesey, a legendary Café Racer.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Some people will tell you that slow is good -- and
it may be, on some days -- but I am here to tell you that fast is better. I've
always believed this, in spite of the trouble it's caused me. Being shot out of
a cannon will always be better than being squeezed out of a tube. That is why
God made fast motorcycles, Bubba....</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">So when I got back from New York and found a fiery
red rocket-style bike in my garage, I realized I was back in the road-testing
business.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">The brand-new Ducati 900 Campione del Mundo Desmodue
Supersport double-barreled magnum Café Racer filled me with feelings of lust
every time I looked at it. Others felt the same way. My garage quickly became a
magnet for drooling superbike groupies. They quarreled and bitched at each other
about who would be first to help me evaluate my new toy.... And I did, of
course, need a certain spectrum of opinions, besides my own, to properly judge
this motorcycle. The Woody Creek Perverse Environmental Testing Facility is a
long way from Daytona or even top-fuel challenge sprints on the Pacific Coast
Highway, where teams of big-bore Kawasakis and Yamahas are said to race head-on
against each other in death-defying games of chicken at 100 miles an hour....</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">No. Not everybody who buys a high-dollar
torque-brute yearns to go out in a ball of fire on a public street in L.A. Some
of us are decent people who want to stay out of the emergency room, but still
blast through neo-gridlock traffic in residential districts whenever we feel
like it.... For that we need fine machinery.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Which we had -- no doubt about that. The Ducati
people in New Jersey had opted, for reasons of their own, to send me the 900SP
for testing -- rather than their 916 crazy-fast, state-of-the-art superbike
track racer. It was far too fast, they said -- and prohibitively expensive -- to
farm out for testing to a gang of half-mad Colorado cowboys who think they're
world-class Café Racers.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">The Ducati 900 is a finely engineered machine. My
neighbors called it beautiful and admired its racing lines. The nasty little
bugger looked like it was going 90 miles an hour when it was standing still in
my garage.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Taking it on the road, though, was a genuinely
terrifying experience. I had no sense of speed until I was going 90 and coming
up fast on a bunch of pickup trucks going into a wet curve along the river. I
went for both brakes, but only the front one worked, and I almost went end over
end. I was out of control staring at the tailpipe of a U.S. Mail truck, still
stabbing frantically at my rear brake pedal, which I just couldn't find.... I am
too tall for these New Age roadracers; they are not built for any rider taller
than five-nine, and the rearset brake pedal was not where I thought it would be.
Midsize Italian pimps who like to race from one café to another on the
boulevards of Rome in a flat-line prone position might like this, but I do not.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">I was hunched over the tank like a person diving
into a pool that got emptied yesterday. Whacko! Bashed into the concrete bottom,
flesh ripped off, a Sausage Creature with no teeth, f-cked-up for the rest of
its life.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">We all love Torque, and some of us have taken it
straight over the high side from time to time -- and there is always Pain in
that.... But there is also Fun, in the deadly element, and Fun is what you get
when you screw this monster on. BOOM! Instant takeoff, no screeching or
squawking around like a fool with your teeth clamping down on your tongue and
your mind completely empty of everything but fear.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">No. This bugger digs right in and shoots you
straight down the pipe, for good or ill.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">On my first takeoff, I hit second gear and went
through the speed limit on a two-lane blacktop highway full of ranch traffic. By
the time I went up to third, I was going 75 and the tach was barely above 4,000
rpm....</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">And that's when it got its second wind. From 4,000
to 6,000 in third will take you from 75 to 95 in two seconds -- and after that,
Bubba, you still have fourth, fifth, and sixth. Ho, ho.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">I never got into sixth, and I didn't get deep into
fifth. This is a shameful admission for a full-bore Café Racer, but let me tell
you something, old sport: This motorcycle is simply too goddamn fast to ride at
speed in any kind of normal road traffic unless you're ready to go straight down
the centerline with your nuts on fire and a silent scream in your throat.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">When aimed in the right direciton at high speed,
though, it has unnatural capabilities. This I unwittingly discovered as I made
my approach to a sharp turn across some railroad tracks, saw that I was going
way too fast and that my only chance was to veer right and screw it on totally,
in a desparate attempt to leapfrog the curve by going airborne.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">It was a bold and reckless move, but it was
necessary. And it worked: I felt like Evil Knievel as I soared across the tracks
with the rain in my eyes and my jaws clamped together in fear. I tried to spit
down on the tracks as I passed them, but my mouth was too dry.... I landed hard
on the edge of the road and lost my grip for a moment as the Ducati began
fishtailing crazily into oncoming traffic. For two or three seconds I came face
to face with the Sausage Creature....</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">But somehow the brute straightened out. I passed a
school bus on the right and then got the bike under control long enough to gear
down and pull off into an abandoned gravel driveway where I stopped and turned
off the engine. My hands had seized up like claws and the rest of my body was
numb. I felt nauseous and I cried for my mama, but nobody heard, then I went
into a trance for 30 or 40 seconds until I was finally able to light a cigarette
and calm down enough to ride home. I was too hysterical to shift gears, so I
went the whole way in first at 40 miles an hour.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Whoops! What am I saying? Tall stories, ho, ho....
We are motorcycle people; we walk tall and we laugh at whatever's funny. We shit
on the chests of the Weird....</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">But when we ride very fast motorcycles, we ride with
immaculate sanity. We might abuse a substance here and there, but only when it's
right. The final measure of any rider's skill is the inverse ratio of his
preferred Traveling Speed to the number of bad scars on his body. It is that
simple: If you ride fast and crash, you are a bad rider. If you go slow and
crash, you are a bad rider. And if you are a bad rider, you should not ride
motorcycles.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">The emergence of the superbike has heightened this
equation drastically. Motorcycle technology has made such a great leap forward.
Take the Ducati. You want optimum cruising speed on this bugger? Try 90 mph in
fifth at 5,500 rpm -- and just then, you see a bull moose in the middle of the
road. WHACKO. Meet the Sausage Creature.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Or maybe not: The Ducati 900 is so finely engineered
and balanced and torqued that you can do 90 mph in fifth through a 35-mph zone
and get away with it. The bike is not just fast -- it is extremely quick and
responsive, and it will do amazing things.... It is a little like riding the
original Vincent Black Shadow, which would outrun an F-86 jet fighter on the
takeoff runway, but at the end, the F-86 would go airborne and the Vincent would
not, and there was no point in trying to turn it. WHAMO! The Sausage Creature
strikes again.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">There is a fundamental difference, however, between
the old Vincents and the new bred of superbikes. If you rode the Black Shadow at
top speed for any length of time, you would almost certainly die. That is why
there are not many life members of the Vincent Black Shadow Society. The Vincent
was like a bullet that went straight; the Ducati is like the magic bullet that
went sideways and hit JFK and the Governor of Texas at the same time. It was
impossible. But so was my terrifying sideways leap across railroad tracks on the
900SP. The bike did it easily with the grace of a fleeing tomcat. The landing
was so easy I remember thinking, goddamnit, if I had screwed it on a little more
I could have gone a lot further.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">Maybe this is the new Café Racer macho. My bike is
so much faster than yours that I dare you to ride it, you lame little turd. Do
you have the balls to ride this <strong>BOTTOMLESS PIT OF TORQUE</strong>?</font>
<p><font face="Courier New">That is the attitude of the New Age superbike freak,
and I am one of them. On some days they are about the most fun you can have with
your clothes on. The Vincent just killed you a lot faster than a superbike will.
A fool couldn't ride the Vincent Black Shadow more than once, but a fool can
ride a Ducati 900 many times, and it will always be bloodcurdling kind of fun.
That is the Curse of Speed which has plagued me all my life. I am a slave to it.
On my tombstone they will carve, &quot;IT NEVER GOT FAST ENOUGH FOR ME.&quot;</font>
