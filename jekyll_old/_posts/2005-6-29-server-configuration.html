<p>Some of what I've done to my new server so far. By the way, it's Fedora Core 2. I'm running Core 2 because Core 3 and later pretty much require yum rather than apt, and yum is a real resource hog and won't reasonably work in 64MB of DRAM.</p>
<ul>
<li>As root: crontab -e, then add <code>25 3 * * * apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -y dist-upgrade</code>.</li>
<li>Create a backup script on a different machine with several lines resembling this: <br/><code>rsync -az -vv --sparse --stats --delete --rsh=ssh root@&lt;hostname&gt;:/home .</code><br/>I put the public key for the archiving machine in root's .ssh/authorized_keys2, so that the script can log in automatically without needing to know root's password.</li>
<li><code>apt-get install ImageMagick ImageMagick-perl</code> (note that they're case-sensitive!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll update this entry as I do more stuff.</p>
