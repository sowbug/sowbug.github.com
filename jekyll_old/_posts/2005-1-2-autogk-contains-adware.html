<p>I regret that I need to retract my earlier 
recommendation to use Auto Gordian Knot. The 1.84 beta 
installs a BHO at c:\windows\system32\dae.dll 
("RESPONSETARGET") that pops up ads while you browse in MSIE.<p>
It's the right of the AutoGK author to put whatever junk he 
wants to in his program (subject to licensing), so I'm not 
going to post instructions how to remove the adware. Instead 
I'll just state that if you don't want adware on your system, 
you should not use AutoGK. It's sad, because it was a useful 
frontend to a complicated toolchain, and I'm not aware of a 
comparable replacement at this moment.
