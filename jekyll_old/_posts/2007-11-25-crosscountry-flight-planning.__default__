I get the impression that paper-based VFR flight planning is a little like learning to do long division in school. Everyone slogs through it, but the moment they get into the real world, they turn to computers (calculators in the case of division, and GPS in the case of navigation). I doubt I'll be any different from anyone else, so as long as it's still fresh in my mind, I'll write down my checklist for cross-country flight planning. This list emphasizes printed information that you can show to your checkride examiner. I really doubt anyone other than a student would create this much paperwork for a flight.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Print out appropriate page from the <a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/">FAA's TFR site</a> to confirm there are no last-minute temporary flight restrictions.</li>
	<li>Print out the appropriate page from my club's maintenance page to confirm the AVIATE maintenance requirements (annual, VOR, 100-hour, altimeter/pitot-static, ELT) are good for this flight.</li>
	<li>Print out the appropriate <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">FAA page</a> showing there are no Emergency Airworthiness Directives applicable to my airplane.</li>
	<li>Print out standard DUATS weather briefing, ideally using 2-up or 4-up two-sided printing to save paper. Get a highlighter and highlight every item of interest, particularly NOTAMs.</li>
	<li>Copy the winds aloft to a separate document. Print it out and put it on your kneeboard. This is useful to get an accurate heading in case your examiner diverts you somewhere.</li>
	<li>Print out flight plan.</li>
	<li>Fill out all parts of the nav log except for the weather-dependent parts (e.g., magnetic heading, deviation, variation, VOR Morse codes and frequencies, and waypoint information, but not wind-correction angles and the like). Make at least one photocopy of this partial nav log. The reason to do this is that there is always a good chance the flight will be canceled at the last minute, and it can be tedious to re-copy all this information to a new page each time you reschedule with new weather information.</li>
	<li>Print out a page containing various information about the flight, some of which is required by <a href="http://risingup.com/fars/info/part91-103-FAR.shtml">FAR 91.103</a>. Here's an example from my checkride:
<pre>    *    Where?
          o Location SNS
          o Alternate WVI
          o Distance 50nm
    * How?
          o Route RHV-E16-KCVH
          o Altitude 5500
    * Who?
          o # of people 2
          o weight and balance 155+180, 20+10, 5
          o Fuel required 5.1 gal
    * When?
          o Time 2:00pm
    * Fill out flight plan
    * Weather/Traffic
          o Get standard briefing
          o Ask for NOTAMs
          o Check for TFRs
          o "Any known traffic delays of which the pilot in command has been advised by ATC"
          o Write down winds aloft
    * Frequencies
          o FSS: OAK 122.5, alternate 122.2 (NOTAM)
          o Flight Following: Norcal App 120.1, 134.5, 133.95
          o ATIS/Ground/Tower for destination
                + SNS ATIS 124.85, Tower 119.4, Ground 121.7
                + WVI ASOS 132.275, CTAF 122.8
    * Runways
          o Draw out traffic patterns
          o Length: SNS: 4800 and 6000; WVI: 4000 and 4500
          o TPA: SNS 900; WVI: 1200
          o Field elevation: SNS 85; WVI 163
          o Slope: not a factor
          o Gross weight requirements: not a factor
    * Takeoff/Landing distances
          o Max weight, 20 degrees Celsius, short-field technique
          o Minimum landing distance is no more than 1265 feet
          o Minimum takeoff less than 1490 feet
    * Navigation Log rates and fuel consumption
          o Climb: 74 knots, 10 min, 1.9 + 1.1 gal, 12nm to climb to 6000 ft
          o Cruise: 115 knots, 8.0 gal/hour
          o Descent: 115 knots, 8.0 gal/hour
    * Descent point (assume 500 ft/min): about two minutes after Hollister</pre></li>
<li>Print out A/FD pages from the <a href="http://naco.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=naco/online/d_afd">FAA site</a> for any airports you might be interested in. If you use 2-up printing, you'll get a nice page you can fold in half and stick in a kneeboard.</li>
<li>Same thing but with airport diagrams, also available on the FAA site.</li>
<li>If you have a color printer, consider paying $1.50 to buy <a href="http://naco.faa.gov/ecomp/Catalog.aspx?a=AERO+NOS+DIGITAL+DSEC">extremely high-resolution TIFFs</a> of sectional and terminal area charts. Then you can print out whatever chart segments you need, again in convenient kneeboard size so you don't have to unfold giant maps in the cockpit.</li>
