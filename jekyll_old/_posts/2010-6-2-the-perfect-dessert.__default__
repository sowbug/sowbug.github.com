I'm not a diabetic, but my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033462?ie=UTF8&tag=sowbug-20">educated belief</a> is that the best way to avoid becoming one is to eat like one. That means avoiding foods that spike blood sugar. After some tinkering, I've developed the perfect dessert for diabetics.

One ounce heavy cream, well-refrigerated
One packet Splenda
Half-teaspoon of cinnamon

Pour cream in a glass. Then pour in the other ingredients (the order is important to avoid bunching at the bottom of the glass). Using an <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/2008/11/ikea-kitchen-things-that-i-lik.html">Ikea frother</a>, mix for a couple minutes until the cream sets. Eat with spoon.

Serves one.

Notes: try with cocoa (though that increases the carbs) unless you're about to go to bed. By happy coincidence, cinnamon is supposedly good for regulating blood sugar, though that's hardly a universal belief, and overdosing on the coumarin in non-Ceylon cinnamon can mess you up.
