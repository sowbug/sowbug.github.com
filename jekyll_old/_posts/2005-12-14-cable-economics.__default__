Why is it that adding a <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2811959391.html">five</a>-<a href="http://www.palowireless.com/infotooth/whatis.asp">dollar</a> <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2001sep/bpd20010918007877.htm">Bluetooth</a> <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2001sep/bpd20010918007877.htm">chip</a> to a <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=microsoft%20keyboard">$40</a> keyboard boosts the price to <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=microsoft%20bluetooth%20keyboard">$75</a>?

Sure, there are software costs, beyond just the silicon, to adding Bluetooth support to a device. But I still think this is the wireless version of "cable economics." Go to your local big-box retailer and try to find any cable at all selling for less than $20. It doesn't matter if the cable cost ten cents to manufacture; the fact is that you're using it to connect two devices that each cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, so chances are you can afford to pay the premium.
