Some time in the past year or so, all my family's geegaws and gadgets suddenly became mini-USB powered. Instead of my Nokia phone using one kind of wall wart, and my Sandisk MP3 player using another kind, our Motorola phones and my iRiver MP3 player are all recharged by the same kind of cable.

This is convenient because I got rid of all the proprietary power adapters, and it's now possible to carry a $2 USB-to-mini-USB cable with me and plug into just about any computer in existence for a quick device recharge.

But the downside is that computers have now become the most expensive power adapters on Earth. In the past, I've left my computer on overnight solely to charge my phone -- and as a bonus once I forgot to re-enable the hibernation feature when I was done, so I actually left it on for a couple days after that. Assuming the computer consumed 100 watts for three days, that was 7.2 kilowatt-hours at around 35 cents each, or $2.52 to charge my cell phone. Granted, that's not a fair calculation given the extra couple days of accidental on-time, but I'm sure it's quite common these days to leave a computer on overnight to charge a device, so that's at least 42 cents spent versus the few cents of power actually consumed for charging purposes.

My solution? I'm going to try something like <a href="http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=YLL-609A">this</a>: yet another geegaw that will probably consume less than 5 watts, assuming 30% efficiency (still 3.6 Kwh/month or $1/month), if I leave it plugged in all the time.

Two steps forward, one step backward.

<strong>Update: It turns out those Motorola bastards use a special cable for charging their devices. I could easily make a cable with the required 165K resistor, but this defeats the purpose of having a single power source and plug for all my devices. Meh.</strong>

<strong>Second update: It pains me to admit this, but at least other devices are compatible with the screwy Motorola power adapter. So I can use that for charging all my devices.</strong>
