<a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot</a> is a really interesting use of RSS. The company sells one product a day, and as far as I can tell doesn't advertise except through their RSS feed. It's a bare-bones shop; no customer service to speak of, no backorders, no rain checks. If you want today's product, order it now. If not, it's gone by tomorrow.

It's like the best of spam (low-cost marketing) without its many problems (lies, cheating, stealing).
