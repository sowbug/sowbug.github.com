These are two of the rules you should follow if you want to be polite when using e-mail.

1. When replying to a mail, don't add other recipients.

2. Don't forward mail.

Exceptions to these rules are (a) the original sender asked you to add other recipients or forward the mail, and (b) you've already asked permission from the original sender to do either of these things.

Examples:

"Hey, Mike, that's a great question. OK if I forward to largergroup@example.com?"

"Hey, Mike, interesting comments. Mind if I forward to your boss?"
