If you play Texas Hold 'Em, you should buy a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=sowbug-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1416903674%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1139511798%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Phil Gordon's Little Green Book : Lessons and Teachings in No Limit Texas Hold'em</a>. It's not a complete guide on how to play the game, but it's an excellent cookbook of recipes to improve your game. My favorite tidbit: the Rule of 4 and Rule of 2, which help you quickly calculate odds of hand improvement. Example: you've flopped an open-ended straight draw and want to know the odds of improving to a straight by the river. There are eight cards in the deck that could make your straight, so by the Rule of 4 you'd multiply 8x4 and conclude that your odds are approximately 32%. (They're actually about 34% but it's close enough to make a quick judgment whether pot odds justify a call.) Likewise, the Rule of 2 applies after the turn card. If you haven't made your straight draw by the turn, multiply that same 8 out cards by 2, and learn that your chances are about 16% of making it on the river. (Again, it's actually 17.4%, but it's close enough.)
