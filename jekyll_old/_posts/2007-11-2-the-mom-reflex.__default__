A friend from college and I once went through a giggle session about how our moms would stick their right arms out to stop us from going through the car windshield whenever they braked hard. Now that it's illegal for kids to be in the front seat at all until they're 120 pounds or whatever the law is now, will evolution no longer favor families with strong Mom Reflexes?
