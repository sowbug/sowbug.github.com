In my mind, Amazon has succeeded in doing something that no other merchant has: it has created a currency that's as valuable as cash. I buy enough stuff on Amazon that I know I'll eventually consume any Amazon gift certificate I receive, and thanks to their <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/06/24/ramasastry.website.prices/">generally</a> reasonable prices, Super Saver shipping, and lack of California sales tax, I don't feel that I'm paying any penalty for buying something from them instead of locally.

In other words, I'd pay $50 for a $50 Amazon gift certificate. But <a href="http://search.ebay.com/amazon-gift-certificate_W0QQfkrZ1QQfromZR8QQsatitleZQ22amazonQ20giftQ20certificateQ22">not everyone</a> shares my view.
