I have a conflict that I don't know how to resolve.

One of my personal values is excellence. To me, excellence means striving to do things as well as possible, expecting better than average, and in general surrounding myself with things (including accomplishments) that would receive a grade "A" when grade "C" would be sufficient.

But another value I prize is tolerance. By this, I mean being capable of accepting harsh conditions with grace. Related concepts are robustness and resilience. In other words, I try not to freak out when something is slightly less than ideal, and I definitely don't admire people who do freak out in those situations.

Obviously, these two values can conflict. In my personal life, I tend to resolve the conflict by distinguishing matters under my control (e.g., can I add just a couple more unit tests to this code before checking it in to source control?) and those that aren't (e.g., this movie is boring but my companions seem to be enjoying it).

So what should I do when I see my children in a situation that we all think is disagreeable, but I'm in control (meaning that I'd act to fix the situation), and they're not in control (meaning I'd advise them to accept the situation gracefully)?

Here's a fairly benign example. We're at home, and the parents make breakfast. For whatever reason our scrambled eggs didn't turn out quite right -- maybe they were overcooked, and we prefer runny eggs. (Let's set aside the valid issue of avoiding waste in order to focus the discussion a bit.) If I were home alone, I might choose to cook new eggs in order to enjoy breakfast exactly how I want it. This is consistent with the personal value of excellence. But clearly I'm not going to teach my children to be fussy eaters; I would be horrified if my kids were at a friend's house for breakfast and started crying because their scrambled eggs were firmer than normal.
