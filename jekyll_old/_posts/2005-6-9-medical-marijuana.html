<p>In <i>
<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=03-1454">
Gonzales v. Raich</a></i>, six Supreme Court justices acted 
against the express will of the people in eight states.* Will 
Bill Frist now include those justices in his rants against 
&quot;activist judges&quot;?</p><p>*Of the ten states with laws permitting 
use of medical marijuana, eight enacted their laws as the 
result of direct popular election.</p>
