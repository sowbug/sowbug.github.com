Yesterday Emily got her third tooth, the upper-left front tooth, and she's already discovered a new trick. She clicks and grinds them together in her crib at night, making a very eerie sound that for some reason is <i>just like bones rubbing together</i>.

It creeps out Mary and me. Emily, however, thinks it's very amusing.
