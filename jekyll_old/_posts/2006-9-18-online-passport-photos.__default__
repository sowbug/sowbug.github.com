<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/renew_your_pass.html">Bruce Schneier</a> finally impelled me to take care of a task on my to-do list: Get passports for everyone in my family. This is a supremely annoying ordeal in terms of paperwork; you need a certified copy of your birth certificate (which to obtain these days in California actually requires a notarized affidavit, thanks to identity thieves and teens making fake IDs) and a fair amount of information about your parents that you may have forgotten or never known.

But the part that used to require the most legwork -- getting two 2-inch square photographs of yourself -- has gotten quite a bit easier in recent years. Here's how to do it.

First, get a digital camera and have someone take your picture. Stand in front of a white wall during the day, and use a flash so it's very well-lit. Heck, while you're there, take 20 pictures so you can pick the one you like.

Second, import your favorite into <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>. Warmify. Apply the "I'm feeling lucky" auto-correction. Remove red-eye if necessary. Erase blemishes. Save a copy of the resulting photo.

Third, upload the photo to <a href="http://www.epassportphoto.com/">ePassportPhoto</a> and fiddle around with the cropping until you get something that matches the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport/guide/composition/composition_874.html">State Department requirements</a>. The cropping tool has a silhouette that makes this pretty easy (though I wish you could drag the crop square after sizing it). When you're done you'll get a link to download a JPEG to your desktop. This picture will have six copies of your cropped portrait in a two-by-three matrix.

Fourth, upload into <a href="http://www.snapfish.com/">Snapfish</a>. Order a 4x6 photo. Now, notice that you can have the photo printed at a local Walgreens, and that it will be ready in less than an hour! (Or have it mailed to your house if you're not in a hurry.)

Fifth, get out some scissors, and you're finished!

Now that I write it up, I see that perhaps this method is no easier than having the pictures taken at a place that does them for you. But you do get tremendous control over the final result; no more half-asleep portraits haunting you every time you travel for the next decade.
