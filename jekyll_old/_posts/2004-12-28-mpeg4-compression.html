<p>I've done some research into backing up 
DVDs. The motivation was my observation that my daughter is 
sure to destroy at least a few DVDs in the coming months while 
she's toddling around the house. Here's the summary:<ul>
  <li>Buy a
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000204SWE?tag=sowbug-20">
  Philips DVP642 DVD player</a>, which costs about $65 and 
  plays MPEG-4 CDs and DVDs.</li>
  <li>Get a DVD burner. This step is optional, but at a 
  minimum you will need a DVD reader.</li>
  <li>Download DVD Decrypter and AutoGK (Auto Gordian Knot), 
  or buy Dr. Divx. (I did both.)</li>
  <li>Make either 700MB backups using AutoGK's default 
  settings, or 1400MB backups using Dr. Divx.</li>
  <li>Get a whole bunch of blanks and backup to DVD or CD-R.</li>
  <li>All done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The DVP642 is not perfect, but it's ideal for this 
  application. The playback quality is not on par with some 
  other players I've seen, as MPEGs seem a little too dark. 
  But it's good enough for people who aren't videophiles like 
  me.</li>
  <li>Dr. Divx and DivX5 are not good enough for 700MB 
  compression. Xvid definitely is.</li>
  <li>I may change my advice to drop Dr. Divx entirely and 
  back up with AutoGK and Xvid for both 700MB and 1400MB 
  profiles. The only reason I wanted Dr. Divx was so I could 
  produce files that were "DivX Home Theater Profile 
  certified," whatever that means. But I've decided that 
  larger backups might as well include AC3 audio, to avoid 
  lossy transformation from AC3 to MP3. Yet the DivX Home 
  Theater Profile apparently doesn't allow for AC3. I don't 
  know why this is the case, because I can't imagine a Home 
  Theater playback device that could play MP3 but not AC3 
  (since regular DVDs require AC3 for playback). If I'm 
  willing to deviate from the profile by including AC3, then 
  Dr. Divx offers me neither better encoding quality nor 
  assurance of compatibility, so there's no point in using it 
  at all.</li>
</ul>
