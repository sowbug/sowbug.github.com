<p>I finally bit the bullet and started 
encoding my whole CD collection. I have 4,201 songs ripped 
with about 50 CDs to go. Mary's happy, because in the process 
I threw out all the jewel cases and put the ripped CDs in 
relatively compact binders.<p>Waiting until I was in my 
mid-30s was the way to go. Extensive A/B testing proved that I 
can't hear as well as I could in my youth, and this saves me 
hard drive space because I can pick a lower encoding quality. 
The setting I'm using is <code>lame -h -V 5 sample.wav 
sample.mp3</code>. This means variable bit rate (VBR) at level 
5 (0 is highest, 9 is lowest). I also normalize the audio 
level to 100% after ripping, and strip leading/trailing 
silence. For 17,763 minutes of music, I have averaged 0.999286 
MB (MB = 2^20 bytes) per minute.</p>
<p>iTunes can organize your directory and filename structure, 
and it has a good UI for fixing ID3 tags.</p>
<p>Other tips:</p>
<p>- Don't let albums titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; slip though. 
Change to &quot;Britney Spears Greatest Hits,&quot; so your MP3 player 
doesn't try to play one week-long album entitled &quot;Greatest 
Hits.&quot;</p>
<p>- Try to limit your genres. Who gives a crap if that Cure 
album from high school is &quot;Darkwave,&quot; &quot;Alternirock,&quot; or 
&quot;Goth&quot;? Just call it &quot;Pop&quot; along with virtually everything 
else you own. Picking broad genres saves a lot of tedious 
debates with yourself in your head.</p>
<p>- It's tempting to get the ID3 year correct for each song 
in greatest hits albums, but honestly, will you ever really 
need to make a playlist consisting only of songs from 1986?</p>
<p>- For God's sake, this is the time to start backing up your 
data. I'm not sure how I would react at this point if I 
suddenly lost 18 gigabytes of MP3s. If nothing else, at least 
copy your music folder to another place on the same hard drive 
from time to time, so that one stray mouse click doesn't 
delete the whole thing.
