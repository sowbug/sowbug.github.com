I'm live-updating my <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/2008/08/yet-another-dell-sucks-blog-po.html">previous blog post</a> with the experience of being on hold. I'm trying to thread this between the work I'm trying to do here in the office, and I have only about another hour of included minutes left on my cellphone this month, so I will probably have to hang up soon. But anyway, thought the entire web would enjoy it.
