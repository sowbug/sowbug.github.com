<p>Some bloggers were playing in a blogger-only WSOP satellite Sunday night. Two short stacks went all-in; one survived. But the survivor had the hammer (7-2 offsuit), and that got <a href="http://biggestron.com/?p=118">the other guy</a> mad, and some <a href="http://sirfwalgman.blogspot.com/2006/04/get-over-it.html">name-calling</a> resulted.</p><p>It may hurt to hear it, but the hammer player made the right decision, and wasn't acting at all in an "essentially random fashion." In low-M situations, the cards aren't that important. You can't afford to see a flop without first exploiting the fold equity of your stack. If you did limp in with half your stack, your opponent would put you all-in on the flop no matter what. So your only move is to go all-in preflop the first time it's folded to you. You hope that everyone else folds, or someone calls with two cards that don't pair up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this works in the other direction, too. The larger stack is going to assume the short stack is playing aggressively:</p>
<pre>
PokerStars No-Limit Hold'em Tourney,
Big Blind is t3000 (3 handed)

Sowbug (t146659)
Button (t89108)
SB (Victim) (t34233)

Preflop: Sowbug is BB with 4h, Qs.    
1 fold, SB (Victim) raises to t9000, Sowbug raises to t15000,
SB (Victim) raises to t34083, Sowbug calls t19083.

Flop: (t68316) 2s, 7c, 4s (2 players)
Victim said, "what?"

Turn: (t68316) Jd (2 players)

River: (t68316) 7s (2 players)

Final Pot: t68316

Results below:  
Sowbug has 4h Qs (two pair, sevens and fours).  
Victim has Qh Ad (one pair, sevens).  
Outcome: Sowbug wins t68316.

<p>Much of the preflop raising was just posturing on my part, but Victim's all-in gave me excellent pot odds (2.6 to 1). Against 22+,ATs+,KTs+,QTs+,JTs,ATo+,KTo, Q4o was a 2.2 to 1 underdog, so I had little choice but to call. Granted, I didn't do this calculation at the time; I knew I'd call when I had to put in 19,083 to win 49,233 and have a chance at guaranteeing at least a second-place finish.</p>
