This morning I took the new <a href="http://caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a> Baby Bullet train to work. It arrived at both stations right on time! 
Timeline:

<ul>
<li>6:14 leave house</li>
<li>6:15 arrive at car</li>
<li>6:24 arrive at station</li>
<li>6:26 parking and ticket purchased</li>
<li>6:37 train leaves</li>
<li>6:57 train arrives</li>
<li>7:15 shuttle drop-off</li>
<li>7:18 at desk</li>
</ul>

That makes 38 minutes of potential worktime (from 6:37 to 7:15) with a five-minute interruption while transferring to the shuttle. I also had an 11-minute cushion at the start because it was my first day. I'd feel comfortable with a 5-minute cushion (leaving by 6:20), so it nets out to a 25-minute commute (58 minutes real time with 33 minutes of work time in the middle). The same time is expected this evening.

I spent $7.50 ($6.00 round-trip train ticket, $1.50 parking). I still have to drive 6.2 miles in the car.

Had I driven to work, I'd have left around 6:45 and arrived somewhere between 7:10 and 7:30, depending on traffic. My evening commute involves leaving at 5:00 and arriving some time between 5:25 and 6:00 (there's much more variation in the evening commute). I would have driven 19 miles each way for a total of 38 miles.

A <a href="http://www.csaa.com/global/articledetail/0,,1008010000%257c4512,00.html">recent AAA study</a> estimates that driving costs 56 cents a mile. That figure is made up in part of amortized fixed expenses that I've already incurred, as well as expenses that do not apply to me -- I do not have a car loan. Thus, it's fallacious to lop off 56 cents per mile not driven. Subtracting interest expenses leaves 51.3 cents per mile, and taking off half the depreciation (fair because the train would mean I'd drive 8,000 miles less per year and AAA's estimate is based on 15,000 miles of driving per year) leaves us with 38.7 cents per mile. Close enough.

Taking the train each day costs $9.89 ($7.50 plus 6.2 car miles x $0.387) and takes 50 net minutes. If I became a frequent train rider and bought 10-day passes and parking passes, I'd spend $102 for 20 days of commuting and $15 for a monthly parking pass, or roughly $5.97 per day (assuming 20 working days in a month). If I became a rabidly dedicated train rider and bought a monthly pass, I'd spend $96.90 or no more than $4.85 per day. Driving each day costs $14.71 (38 car miles x $0.387) and takes from 55 minutes to 105 minutes.

Summary:

<ul>
<li><b>Commute Time</b><ul><li>Train: 50 minutes, consistently.</li><li>Car: 55 minutes to 105 minutes, highly variable.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Cost</b><ul><li>Train: $5 to $10.</li><li>Car: $14.75.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

Conclusion:

I save money by taking the train, even if I take it sporadically. I also spend less time commuting, <i>assuming</i> I am able to get work done on the train.
