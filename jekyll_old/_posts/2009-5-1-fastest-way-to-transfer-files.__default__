I have two Linux machines and a gigantic file on one that I want on the other. The two machines are connected by Ethernet. scp is incredibly slow, about 1.6MB/second. I don't feel like setting up samba or nfs on either. I don't care about security, authenticity, or integrity; I can md5sum if necessary, and both machines are isolated from the Internet.

I assumed the scp slowness was a CPU thing with ssh encryption, but someone on the web said the problem was in fact at a lower level (64K buffer sizes in ssh). The best solution I came up with was <b>python -c "import SimpleHTTPServer;SimpleHTTPServer.test()"</b> on the source machine and then <b>wget source:8000 myfile</b> on the other machine. That got me about 8MB/sec, which was barely fast enough to get the job done, so I stopped investigating.

But for next time, there must be a clever command-line solution that a Linux guru can recommend. Maybe piping through nc?
