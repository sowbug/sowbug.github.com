Anyone have advice how to get rid of a raccoon?

Every night he knocks over my trash can. I run outside, swinging a stick and yelling at him. He takes a cool five or ten seconds to size me up and then saunters away, leaving me to experience my son's dirty diapers all over again. We put all our food scraps in the garbage disposal and worm composter, so I don't know what he's interested in getting out of our trash can.

He's about as big as my son, and probably about as smart, too. I don't really want to kill either of them, so poison and traps are out.

Your thoughts would be appreciated.

<b>Update 3/25/2007</b>: Thanks for all the suggestions. I screwed a hook into the fence, looped a bungee cord through the can handle, and hooked the cord onto the fence hook. There is about an inch of slack in the cord, so pushing over the can just makes it spring back into place. I've heard the raccoon rambling around the trash can, but he hasn't knocked it over since.
