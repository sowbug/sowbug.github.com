Went out on a limb tonight after reading <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/03/singapores_coolass_h.html">Cory's article</a> about hard drive enclosures that play DivX movies. I picked up a <a href="http://www.airlinktek.com/english/prod_mg25.htm">Media Gate MG-25</a> from <a href="http://www.shop4tech.com/">Shop4Tech</a> along with an 80 gig 2.5-inch hard drive from <a href="http://www.directron.com/mk8025gas.html">Directron</a>. Total cost before tax & shipping: about $183. Both components should arrive before the end of the week. Yee haw, at last I have my video iPod!

Update: see <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/archives/000213.html">two-month checkup</a>.
