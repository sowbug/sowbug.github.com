This allows you to skip the Linux step.

<ol>
<li>Download the OpenSSL tarball and extract it.</li>
<li>Find the file util\mk1mf.pl.</li>
<li>Find the line <code>($key,$val)=/^([^=]+)=(.*)/;</code> and add this line after it: <code>$val =~ s/\s+$//;</code> (this is at line 487 in OpenSSL 0.9.7c)</li>
<li>Now follow the instructions that came with the tarball.</li>
</ol>

The problem is that mk1mf.pl parses the generated MINFO file into key-value pairs, but in the process picks up the end-of-line character at the end of each value. I bet this is a problem only if you install Cygwin Perl with DOS line endings, which I did (though I tried converting MINFO to Unix linefeeds and it still didn't work).
