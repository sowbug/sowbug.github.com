This might be a contemporary urban legend, but the rumor is that Google Android and Palm WebOS don't use multitouch in their UIs because of Apple's <a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/01/27/iphone_patent_granted/">Patent #7,479,949</a>. But how can this be if Keanu Reeves invented multitouch back in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/">1995</a>? Check it out here:

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l_CaxYF56jY&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/l_CaxYF56jY&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

At 1:21, he stretches a small planet on the screen using both hands.

At 2:02, he stretches a rectangle.

Heck, at 0:35 he even says iPhone! (probably "eye phones.")

This is a patent issue, so nothing about it is simple. But it seems like it's an old, non-novel idea to use two appendages on a touch screen to change zoom level on an object in the UI.
