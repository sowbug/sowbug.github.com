I've used Picasa for a couple years now, and I still don't get it. Here's my workflow:

1. Take pictures with camera.
2. Stick SD card from camera into computer.
3. Import pictures from SD card to home fileserver.
4. Browse, edit, remove red-eye, torture relatives with more pictures of kids, etc.

But here's where it breaks down. At step 3, Picasa asks me where I want to save the pictures. I <em>must</em> type a directory name; it won't store them in the root of the directory specified in Picasa preferences. So in effect, I must supply metadata to describe my new pictures, and I always end up typing "pictures I took in the last few days" or more likely "asdfasdsdfs."

Can you imagine how successful Gmail would have been if it popped up a dialog forcing you to type a label name each time a new email came in? Or even worse, a single mandatory label to cover all email that had arrived in the last 24 hours?

Picasa, it's <em>your</em> job to organize my pictures for me. Don't make me do it for you!

This wouldn't be such a problem if I could type the nonsense directory name, do the import, and then immediately see what I imported. But no, Picasa doesn't know about pictures it's imported until it re-scans watched directories. This means it can be minutes after the import before I actually get to see my pictures. By then I've usually switched to another task (like writing a griping blog post about my photo-management software) and I forget to return to it.

It's possible I've totally missed the Zen of Picasa. Perhaps because it came from Google I expect it to act like other Google products: it should be a giant funnel for unorganized data, and it should magically present that data in a sensible fashion. Instead, Picasa refuses to accept unorganized data, and it briefly (but at a critical time) loses all knowledge of the newest data I've entrusted to it. I don't get it.
