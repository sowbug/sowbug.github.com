I'd like to spend some time learning to create sprite artwork, and I have a suspicion that my left-brain mind will have a better chance making 3D models and then rendering them as flat 32x32 PNGs.

I happen to have some incredible Cinema 4D models supplied to me by a talented artist, which I could use as a starting point. So I'm tempted to buy it and start there. But I've also admired POV-Ray's galleries for years, and I'm sure it could also do what I want.

Should go the commercial, proprietary Cinema 4D route, or open-source POV-Ray, or something else entirely? I'm sure there are a thousand right answers to that question, so I'll try asking differently. Given that I have an attention span of maybe a weekend and virtually no 3D modeling experience, which toolset is most likely to give good short-term results?
