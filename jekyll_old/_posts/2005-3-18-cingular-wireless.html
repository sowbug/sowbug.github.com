<p>AT&T Wireless customers, one of whom is 
me, were switched over to Cingular a few months ago following 
the merger. My new carrier has a trick to either get people to 
pay their bills earlier, or charge them hard-to-dispute 
penalties for unintentionally paying a few days late.<p>
Nowhere on the bill does it give a date when the bill is due. 
Instead, in the "Date Due" field it says "UPON RECEIPT." In 
the itemized portion of the bill it says a "late fee may be 
applied for amounts unpaid 22 days after the date the invoice 
was mailed." But there's no indication when the invoice was 
mailed. There is no postmark. There is a "Date of Invoice," 
but that could be before or after the mailing date -- indeed, 
on my latest bill the itemized charges stopped three days 
before the date of invoice, so they could very well have 
mailed it with a post-dated invoice.</p>
<p>Since it's impossible to tell with certainty when this 
22-day period begins or ends, most people will simply pay the 
bill right away rather than risk being late. And if they are 
charged a late fee, it'll be hard to determine whether it was 
justified.</p>
<p>Evil, inconvenient, and lame.</p>
<p>I hear some readers saying that the due date is "right 
away," and that I have no right to demand a grace period. The 
most concise answer I can come up with to that position is "<b>WRONG</b>." 
A slightly less pithy response is that this is a contract, and 
both parties should be able to know the exact terms of the 
contract.
