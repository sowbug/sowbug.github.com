<p>It seems like every other day <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/diy-ultrasilent-pc-163162.php">another article</a> appears about building a <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/">silent PC</a>. Someone needs to complete this line of research once and for all, and invent the noise-<i>consuming</i> PC. It would be a combination of an already-quiet PC and a powerful noise-canceling circuit. Then your room would be quieter with the PC on than with it off.</p>
