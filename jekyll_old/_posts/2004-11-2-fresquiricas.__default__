Mary discovered Guerrero-brand "Fresqui-Ricas" tortillas at the local supermarket last week. They're raw; you cook them for about 30 seconds in a pan right before you eat them. If you've ever had a real, just-made tortilla, you know there's no comparison with one from a package. These taste nearly as good. Mmmmm!
