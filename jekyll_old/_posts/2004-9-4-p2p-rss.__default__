Certain concepts keep swimming around in my head lately. There must be some kind of wonderful union of them.

<ul><li>RSS/Atom: subscribe to content so you don't have to keep checking websites for updates.</li><li>RSS 2.0 enclosures: set up a daemon on your machine to download files linked in RSS feeds at night when you don't care about bandwidth usage.</li><li>Bittorrent: swarm content quickly from peers.</li><li>Peer to peer: if Bittorrent could be purely peer to peer, it would be easier to use it.</li><li>Venti: file data (as opposed to metadata) is identified by SHA-1 hashes rather than locations.</li><li>Zeroconf: easy discovery of people on your subnet.</li></ul>

The "wonderful union" is something where every morning you go to a local page on your browser that is like a newspaper containing all the channels you've subscribed to, and if the big files mentioned in the page (mp3, video) aren't downloaded yet to your local machine, they're swarmed to your machine from people close to you so you get them really quickly and without crushing some poor server that got mentioned on Boing Boing.
