If your Tivo starts stuttering, don't run right out to newegg.com and buy a new drive as I did. First, check and see whether your 15-month old toddler shoved the Tivo box back against the wall, covering the air vent.

That's what happened to me. After extensive testing of the drive and finding nothing, I remembered that in the past few weeks, Emily had been quite interested in moving consumer electronics around the house. Tivo moved again; problem solved.
