After much research and rationalizing, I ended up going with the least geeky solution to connectivity at my new address: plain old SBC phone service, no long distance, flat rate, for $11/month. The phone line comes to about $18/month with taxes (a whopping 63.6% tax rate). Then it looks like I'll be going with Sonic.net for DSL: 1.5/384, 8 static IP addresses for an introductory price of $45 later going to $70 a month. Total monthly: $63.

Other options were SBC all the way: $18 + $75 for "Pro-S" DSL = $93/month, or Speakeasy dry-pair DSL and Vonage: $66 + $15 = $81/month.

As much as I'd like to try VoIP, the numbers don't work out. My wife and I don't have a big phone bill to begin with, so there isn't much economic incentive to try it.
