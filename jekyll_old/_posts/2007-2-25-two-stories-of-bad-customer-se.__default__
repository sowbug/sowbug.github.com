For constructive discussion of customer service, go read <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth's blog</a>. This is just a rant.

First incident: I eat at a local restaurant that's running a coupon promotion. It turns out the actual coupon I had with me expired a few days ago, though the identical coupon promotion is still running. In other words, if I'd clipped the coupon from this week's paper instead of last week's, then I'd have the same coupon but with a different expiration date. The waitress takes it to her boss who barks out fairly rudely that they don't honor expired coupons.

Fine, so I don't save $5. I'll live. But I certainly don't feel like these people are trying to build up repeat business. I walk up to the cashier to pay, and my waitress rings up the check. Then the following dialog:

<blockquote><font size="-1">
<p>Me: By the way, it's fine if your boss wants to be strict about coupons, but I think it's foolish if she wants people to ever come back to this restaurant again.</p>
<p>Waitress: Uh, that's why coupons have expiration dates. You should have paid more attention.</p>
<p>Me: Wait, you're saying you think she did the right thing? You think that was good business?</p>
<p>Waitress: ... and if you're deciding whether to come back for anything except whether the food is good, then you're foolish... <i>(and then she turns her back and walks away)</i></p></font></blockquote>

In case you're wondering, this isn't the Soup N<nobr>azi</nobr> -- all four adults in my party agreed that the food was mediocre, and nowhere near good enough to make up for abuse like that.

Second incident: when <a href="http://americanexpress.com/">American Express</a>'s website is acting squirrely, and you call to get the issue resolved, and you're transfered eight times to nine different people who each ask for your account number, mother's maiden name, and your story why you're calling, and then at the end of your story they say they need to transfer you, then your story changes quickly to "I want to close my account."

Which is what happened. And strangely enough, the last person did <i>not</i> ask for my story; she just tapped her keyboard a few times and said "OK, sir, your account will be closed in 24 hours."

Amazing. American Express has at least nine people answering phones on a Sunday afternoon. None of them is able to help me change a simple preference on my account. None of them is willing to take responsibility for helping me with my problem. A nineteen-year relationship with a credit card company ends abruptly after 20 minutes on the phone, and they didn't even care enough to ask me why.
