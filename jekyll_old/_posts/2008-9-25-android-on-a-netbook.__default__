Before the end of the year, it'll be possible to download an Android LiveCD ISO for commodity PCs. Soon after that, all netbook vendors will abandon their custom Linux distributions and begin shipping Android instead.

Android is the Linux desktop that the Linux community has been waiting for. It's the chrome around the kernel that makes Linux usable by everyone's kids and everyone's parents. But unlike Apple's OS X (which is also chrome around an open-source kernel), Android will be open source.

Long: cloud computing, Intel, Amazon, Google, and small app development shops.

Neutral: Apple, Adobe, Yahoo.

Short: Microsoft, Symantec, Intuit, Computer Associates. Probably Garmin.
