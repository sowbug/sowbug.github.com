I'd be more interested in the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/pinch-media-data-shows-the-average-shelf-life-of-an-iphone-app-is-less-than-30-days/">data</a> showing usage patterns of Apple App Store apps if I could compare desktop app usage. Let me think of some of the retail software I've bought:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://flstudio.image-line.com/">FL Studio</a> for when I was going to be a hobby techno musician. Installed it, decided I sucked as a musician.</li>
<li>A home-design CAD/CAM-style application whose name I can't remember. I think I wanted help figuring out how to rearrange some stuff in the kitchen. I ended up sketching it on a piece of paper because the program crashed too often. Today I'd use <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a>, now that it's ad-supported.</li>
