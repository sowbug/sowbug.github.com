<p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/12/the_security_th_1.html">Bruce Schneier</a> got it right. If you're OK with George Bush spying on Americans because the war on terror gives him the power to ignore the law and the U.S. Constitution, then you had better be especially OK with President Michael Moore spying on you, too. (<b><i>President Michael Moore?!?!</i></b> Sure, that sounds silly. But in 1950, would you have bet on Ronald Reagan for President? In 1985, would you have bet on Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor of California? How about Cher's husband in 1977 as a U.S. Congressman?)</p><p>The war on terror ain't ending. At least, I'm not planning on attending the victory party when they throw one, not unless security is REALLY tight. So when Michael Moore is President, the war on terror will still be in effect, and President Moore will cite President Bush as precedent for his continuing power to ignore the law, the Constitution, the Congress, and the U.S. Supreme Court, as long as he thinks he's making our country safer from our government's enemies.</p><p>This isn't about politics. It's not about whether you support President Bush. It's about whether you believe the law and the U.S. Constitution should apply to every American, including the American government.</p>
