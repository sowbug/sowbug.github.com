I wish I could be involved in more <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/22/alaska.bridge.ap/">"abandoned" projects like this</a>:

<em>U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young, both Republicans, championed the project through Congress two years ago, securing more than $200 million for the bridge.... Under mounting political pressure over pork projects, Congress stripped the earmark -- or stipulation -- that the money be used for the airport, but still sent the money to the state for any use it deemed appropriate.</em>

In other words, Congress writes a check to the State of Alaska for $200 million and writes "For Bridge To Nowhere" in the memo section. People scream "pork!!!" and Congress responds by crossing out the memo before dropping the check in the mail. Sigh.
