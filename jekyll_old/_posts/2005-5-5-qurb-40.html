<p>Congratulations to my friends and former 
coworkers at
<a href="http://www.qurb.com/">
Qurb</a>, who just released their
<a href="http://www.qurb.com/beta">
4.0 beta</a>. As I understand it, 4.0's principal new feature 
is an RSS/Atom aggregator. &quot;Feed reader&quot; is a less techy term 
for the same thing, but it's less likely to be properly 
indexed by search engines ;).<p>It seems like just last week 
that 3.0 went final. Qurb is really picking up steam!
