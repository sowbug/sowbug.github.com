Why do BIOS default configurations specify that the boot process should die if a keyboard isn't attached? Right now, as you read this, I bet there are at least three people driving down the highway expecting to ssh into their new headless servers when they reach their destination. This is how it happens:

1. Spend N hours getting the server just right.
2. Reboot a few times to make sure it works.
3. Unhook the monitor and keyboard.
4. Shut down. Unplug.
5. Put server in its permanent spot. Plug back in.
6. Press power. See blinking light.
7. Leave.
8. #)(#$%*#@!@(!@!!!!!
9. Drive back.
10. Go back to step 1 for a slightly smaller value of N.
