<p>As all three of you noticed, my server died last Wednesday. It's a <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User Mode Linux</a> server, and my trusty nightly rsync backup script sorta stopped working back in November 2004, so when the server disappeared, yeah, I lost some data.</p><p>Fortunately, November 2004 was just before my <a href="http://emilytsao.aboutmybaby.com/">son</a> was born, so blog entries dropped off dramatically around then, and there wasn't a lot to reconstruct. I got help from several sources:</p><ul>
<li>Bloglines caches blogs in a format that's pretty faithful to the original. I was able to save their Javascript page, fiddle with it a little, then view the result in my browser. Then I copied the HTML into an HTML editor, and that was close enough to the original content.</li>
<li>For metadata like timestamps, I asked around and luckily a few friends had RSS and Atom feeds left over on their computers. It helps to know people working at a <a href="http://www.qurb.com/">company</a> developing blog software. :) Thanks, Antony and Erik!</li>
<li><a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop Search</a>'s web history helped with some HTML recovery.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to get all but about five late-2004 items perfectly recovered. Apologies in advance when those show up, incorrectly, as "updated" in your aggregator.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, I'm now hosted at <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>. No comment yet on their reliability, but their configuration pages are quite nice. I look forward to the commercialization of <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</a>; I suspect you get more bang for the buck than UML.</p>

<p>Update: For some reason my registrar decided to switch my domain to their parked host webserver, so anyone visiting sees a "coming soon!" page instead of mine. I believe I fixed the problem two hours ago, but their nameservers are still serving the incorrect address. What good is a 60-minute TTL if you can't get your changes published more quickly than that?</p>
