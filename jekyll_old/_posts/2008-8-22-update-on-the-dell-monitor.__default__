Soon after my <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/2008/08/yet-another-dell-sucks-blog-po.html">real-time rage</a> hit the web, I saw a few hits in my server logs that reverse-mapped to various dell.com addresses. I knew then that my <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/26/1321211">ploy</a> was working, and sure enough, not more than 20 minutes later I got a very polite email from Larry Robinson, who's a Dell Online Community Outreach Liaison. I also got a ping from Jimmy Parish, also of Dell, on Facebook.

Long story short, the company got a new monitor out to me, and it arrived last night. We hooked it up this morning in the office, and it works great. I'm still waiting for return instructions for the broken monitor, but at least nobody's blocked at this point.

Larry speculated that the original disconnect was that the CSRs were looking at the order date, not the ship date, when they told me to get lost before the 21-day return period. He said the company does take these kinds of incidents seriously, and tries to modify their internal procedures to handle things better. I appreciate that; the last thing I want to hear is that they're making an exception for me just because I complained in a public forum, because that doesn't help me the next time I get into a situation.

Since my blog post I've heard many Dell stories from friends, some unpleasant, but many satisfactory, and a few outright pleasant. If I underweight the part of the experience involving ignorant front-line CSRs and focus on the actual humans who took a few moments to understand the problem, then my experience was slightly on the pleasant side, too. So Dell manages to stay out of my personal Hall of Shame, and I'll probably buy from them again.... especially likely when the mini Inspiron comes out soon. :)
