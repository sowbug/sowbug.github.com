  <p>I had a good debugging session over the last few nights and want to write down
my notes here.</p>

<p>The <a href="/post/19682029334/the-programmer-works">AVR Programmer</a> initially worked
with a target &lsquo;328p, but it hung when programming a second build of the board,
and then again on a particular ATtiny13A that I was using for the <a href="/post/20906913903/the-hypna-go-go">Hypna Go
Go</a>. Oddly, it worked for another &lsquo;13A that
I was using on the same project. The board was flaky, and as a result, I
couldn&rsquo;t keep my promise to myself to never again ISP-program another AVR
without a programmer I&rsquo;d built myself.</p>

<p>A few nights ago, while getting ready for the latest and greatest version of
the board to arrive from the factory, I decided to take a look at what was
going on. I got out my <a href="http://www.saleae.com/">Saleae Logic</a> and watched the
SPI traffic. Perfect… except that the target &lsquo;13A never responded on MISO. I
swapped in a known-good programmer, confirmed it worked, but then saw that the
logic signal patterns were identical. <em>The target wasn&rsquo;t responding, but the
known-good programmer was programming it!</em></p>

<p>I suspected bad logic probe connections… nope. They were fine.</p>

<p>Getting a bit frantic, I zoomed out in the Logic app, and immediately figured
out why the target wasn&rsquo;t responding. The first cycle through the
initialization sequence (the only cycle I&rsquo;d been examining), it always failed.
But the second cycle succeeded, and I never saw this until I zoomed out.</p>

<p>Next question: why was the known-good good? I re-read the datasheet for the
&lsquo;13A and saw that if the programmer couldn&rsquo;t guarantee SCK was low on target
powerup (which indeed applied in both my and the known-good programmer cases),
an alternate way to get into programming mode was to pulse /RESET high for a
bit. I could see the known-good doing this between the first bad and second
good cycles, and my firmware was doing the same thing, so what was the
difference?</p>

<p>Back to my programmer under the logic analyzer. Zoom out… and see that in fact
/RESET was staying low consistently. Aha! That&rsquo;s the problem. But why was it
happening?</p>

<p>It turns out that the LUFA code doesn&rsquo;t pulse /RESET by sending it high.
Instead it <em>tristates</em> the pin. This makes sense because you want your
programmer to disconnect from the target when you&rsquo;re done so that /RESET can
go back high on its own. This is fine, except that my programmer has a
74AHC125 buffer between the &lsquo;32u2 and the ISP outputs, and <em>a tristate output
entering the buffer leaves as a low logic signal</em>. This is why my programmer
wasn&rsquo;t pulsing /RESET, and it&rsquo;s why programming <em>sometimes</em> worked if the
powerup sequence happened to be right, or if the chip in question (such as
most 328p&rsquo;s or some 13A&rsquo;s) happened to be a more tolerant sample.</p>

<p>Once I understood the problem, <a href="https://github.com/sowbug
/lufa-lib/commit/258ecc31c993826bf5c520699c38b9d8183b00cb">the fix was easy</a>. Change LUFA to
pulse /RESET with explicit logic levels, and insert buffer enable/disable code
at the appropriate places. So far, it&rsquo;s been running flawlessly.</p>
