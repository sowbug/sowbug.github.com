  <h1><a href="https://sowbug.github.io/post/2012-03-10-xmega-breakout-board/" title="XMEGA Breakout Board">XMEGA Breakout Board</a></h1>
  <p>(Yes, apparently Atmel spells it in all caps.)</p>

<p>Because the <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/avr-programmer">AVR Programmer</a> will
support SPI-based ISP, PDI for XMEGAs, and TPI for low-end &lsquo;tinys, I need to
acquire test targets of each kind. Unfortunately, XMEGA isn&rsquo;t available as a
DIP, which means it&rsquo;s breakout board time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a half-hearted resolution to design and build rather than buy tools
where possible, because, well, because building is fun. That rules out buying
the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9546">SparkFun board</a> and Atmel&rsquo;s own
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/xplain">XPLAIN series</a> (even though the Atmel boards are
pretty reasonably priced for all the bells and whistles they include). But I
can still build on others&rsquo; work. Current influences for my design:</p>

<ul>
<li>David Watson&rsquo;s <a href="http://david.neonquill.com/projects/xmega_breakout/">Xmega 4 breakout</a>. OSHW, and pretty good-looking for a homemade prototype (Laen&rsquo;s deep purple boards always help with the aesthetics). But it&rsquo;s missing USB and a voltage regulator, which I&rsquo;d really prefer to lower the cable count on my desk.</li>
<li>Batsocks&rsquo; <a href="http://www.batsocks.co.uk/products/BreadMate/XMega%20PDI.htm">BreadMate XMega</a>. Pretty much perfect; gives you that &ldquo;ooh I want it&rdquo; feeling that you also get when you see the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>. But like the Teensy, it&rsquo;s not OSHW, so I can&rsquo;t really do anything with it. (I&rsquo;d have been happy to buy at least one if the source were provided.) <strong>Update 5/23/2012: Nigel has open-sourced the USB version of the project. As promised I&rsquo;ve bought one; it&rsquo;s on its way from Batsocks now!</strong></li>
<li><a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3527&amp;p=35454">brendan0powers&rsquo; board</a>. This board mostly confirms that I want to steer clear of QFN. It has a good feature set (USB, vreg, missing a crystal).</li>
</ul>

<p>I want David&rsquo;s layout, Brendan&rsquo;s USB, no FTDI header, and Batsocks&rsquo;
manufacturing chops. EAGLE, here I come!</p>
