  <p>I want a device that looks nice enough to keep on a coffee table, that has a
small number of buttons, that emits well-documented RF signals in response to
those buttons, that has some kind of reasonable security story, and that is
manufactured in enough quantity that itâ€™s cheap and not hard to find. This
would be a <strong>hobbyist remote control</strong>. It would allow me to build ugly
devices that I could hide in a cabinet, then control them with something not
ugly.</p>

<p>Today, here are my options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repurpose a universal remote. Build an IR receiver into my project. Pick some RC-5 codes. This solution fails because it&rsquo;s line-of-sight. And most universal remotes have an absurdly large number of buttons.</li>
<li>Use a 315/433MHz remote and receiver. <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Free-Shipping-Universal-4-Channel-433mhz-RF-Wireless-Remote-Control-Module-2262-2272-Remote-Controler-Kit/1725790_32381477987.html">Here&rsquo;s one example</a>. This is close to what I want, but the documentation isn&rsquo;t great, the security is probably poor, the appearance and form factor are not to my taste, and it&rsquo;s not clear whether I&rsquo;d be able to buy another receiver that works with it (for starters, which of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPD433">69 LPD433 channels</a> does this one use? Probably 433.925MHz, but how do I know for sure?).</li>
<li>Use a phone and write a BLE app that talks to a BLE receiver. This is what all the cool kids are doing these days. But it doesn&rsquo;t help me when I&rsquo;m at work and my visiting mother-in-law wants to [lower the blinds/turn on the Christmas tree/calibrate the flux capacitor].</li>
<li>Repurpose a quadcopter remote, many of which use the NRF24L01+. This fails many of my criteria, but I did spend some time researching how well that chip has penetrated the consumer market.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this device exist? If it did, would anyone but me buy it?</p>
