  <p>The 6809E is running! Once the weekend began with the chip in my possession,
like any good engineer I resisted the urge to immediately let out the blue
smoke and instead sat down with the datasheet. The moment I saw the word
&ldquo;clock&rdquo; I remembered that I hadn&rsquo;t bought a 1MHz oscillator. Fortunately,
rather than jumping in the car and driving to
<a href="http://www.halted.com/">Halted</a>, I continued reading and discovered that
clocking wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy.</p>

<p>The 6809E doesn&rsquo;t take a single clock input like other processors I&rsquo;ve seen
(mostly AVRs and a few PICs). Instead, it has a Q input and an E input.
Individually they look like regular 50%-duty square waves, but they&rsquo;re
synchronized, so you can&rsquo;t just add two oscillators; rather, E&rsquo;s rising edge
must follow Q&rsquo;s rising edge by at least 200ns (a fifth of a clock cycle on a
1MHz processor). If you draw this on paper, it ends up looking like E is
simply phase-shifted by a quarter-cycle. I am not sure why Motorola made this
an external requirement of the &lsquo;09. The datasheet only says &ldquo;this approach
minimizes clock skew inherent with an internal buffer.&rdquo; If I, as a system
designer, am supposed to care about that, then I suppose there are external
events that depend on the timing of the E edges. Still, it seems Motorola
could have put the Q/E-generating circuitry in the chip, and run the E signal
out on a pin.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a requirement. My first instinct was to get a trusty old
ATtiny13A to generate the clock signals, but my first coding attempt produced
only a 78kHz signal, below the 105kHz minimum frequency implied by the &lsquo;09&rsquo;s
bus timing characteristics in the datasheet. I could have easily optimized the
code; using back-of-the-envelope calculations, having 9.6 million AVR
instructions per second and wanting maybe 500kHz cycles for now, that gave me
about 19 instructions to generate a clock cycle, which ought to be easily
doable. But I was ready for a break, and besides, it was time for lunch, so I
decided to get out of the house.</p>

<p>I returned with a 74HC109, which was the closest I could find on a Saturday to
the 74LS76-based circuit in the datasheet:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mAfPmbB5lJk/TxJrXZQo5gI/AAAAAAAAA5s/dxULPgV8HwU/s554/MC6809_clock_generator.png" alt="Q/E clock generator
circuit" /></p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any oscillators at all, so I still had to use the ATtiny for
the basic clock. After breadboarding it all up, I was getting a beautiful
300kHz Q/E signal out of the &lsquo;109. Time to work the &lsquo;09 into my circuit!</p>

<p>This part was tedious but straightforward. Wire up all the pins that can have
a constant state for now (IRQ, HALT, etc.). Connect Q and E. Leave the address
bus disconnected except for headers to attach logic-probe pins. Re-read the
datasheet to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t mixing up inputs and outputs. Count the pins
to avoid expensive off-by-one errors.</p>

<p>The data pins are a neat trick that
<a href="http://quinndunki.com/blondihacks/?p=680">Quinn</a> recently wrote about, and it
helps to understand the reset process to appreciate it. On RESET&rsquo;s rising
edge, the processor reads a 16-bit address from the reset vector (at $FFFE),
then jumps there and starts executing code. In a normal 6809-based computer,
$FFFE would map to ROM, and the address in the vector would point to the reset
routine, also in ROM. But we don&rsquo;t have ROM yet, and even if we did, we don&rsquo;t
have any code to put in it. So instead, we choose a single byte and wire it
manually to the D0-D7 pins. But which byte? In the case of the 6809, $12 is a
good choice. It&rsquo;s the NOP (no operation) opcode, which is always pretty safe
to run. If we permanently set the data bus to $12, then this is the reset
sequence:</p>

<ol>
<li>CPU reads the top half of the reset routine from $FFFE. It&rsquo;s $12.</li>
<li>CPU reads the bottom half of the reset routine from $FFFF. It&rsquo;s $12, too. So the reset code starts at $1212. CPU jumps there.</li>
<li>CPU reads the opcode at $1212. You guessed it: it&rsquo;s $12. That&rsquo;s a one-byte opcode, so it executes the operation, which does little more than increasing the program counter to $1213.</li>
<li>CPU reads the opcode at $1213. It&rsquo;s $12. And so on.</li>
</ol>

<p>If our prediction is correct, on the address bus we should see this sequence:
$FFFE, $FFFF, $1212, $1213, $1214, and so on. It&rsquo;s not useful computation, but
observing this sequence lets us know we&rsquo;re running the CPU correctly.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s the theory. In practice I saw the reset vector being read, then
an orderly but mysterious sequence: 0, 1, F, 0, F, 0, 2, 3, F, 0, F, 0, 4, 5,
F, 0, F, 0, 6, 7, F, 0, F, 0 (I love my <a href="http://www.saleae.com/Logic">Saleae
Logic</a>, but man I wish it had something like 64
inputs. Meanwhile, this is just the lower 4 bits of the address bus). Still, I
was excited because I was seeing real signals coming out of the &lsquo;09, which
meant my clock circuit worked!</p>

<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why the address bus wasn&rsquo;t matching what I expected.
I thought about changing the hardcoded data bus to $0E, which would have put
it into a perma-loop JMPing from $0E0E to $0E0E. I began moving the data
jumpers, and _noticed that their bus strip wasn&rsquo;t connected to anything!_ The
data bus had been floating, and the &lsquo;09 (bless its heart) responded by reading
the pins as zeroes. The weird sequence earlier now made sense, as NEG is
opcode $00, takes a single-byte argument, and completes in six cycles. The CPU
was already exceeding my expectations: I&rsquo;d asked it to do nothing but cycle
through instructions, and it was busily negating address $0! (_I&rsquo;m still not
convinced this is correct. Why would NEG take a single-byte argument, rather
than a two-byte address? Is this an odd 6809 architecture limitation?)
_<strong>Update: the 6809 has this cool mode called &ldquo;Direct,&rdquo; which takes the high 8
bits from a register, and the low 8 bits from the opcode argument. This is why
0, 0 translated to NEG $0000. It&rsquo;s a little like x86 segment registers, but
without the intense pain!</strong></p>

<p>Hooking the bus up properly to Vcc and GND gave the expected results, jumping
to $1212 and quickly working its way up the address space. Excellent!</p>

<p>After a break for dinner, I decided to switch over to software for a while. I
got the ATtiny&rsquo;s pure bit-banging Q/E generation code up to about 300kHz, so I
was able to ditch the &lsquo;109 for now. (<a href="https://github.com/sowbug/8821">That
code</a> is now checked in.) Although I think
it&rsquo;s cool to have hacked the clock signal without an oscillator, I&rsquo;m pretty
sure I&rsquo;ll relent and get a real 4MHz oscillator, because I want Joust to run
at the correct, original speed, and it would be a lot of avoidable work to get
the ATtiny oscillating at exactly the right rate.</p>
