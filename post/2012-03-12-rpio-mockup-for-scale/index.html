<p>Some reference objects for
<a href="http://www.sowbug.com/post/19162096061/rpio-a-raspberry-pi-breakout-
board">RPio</a> scale. That&rsquo;s a credit card (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7810">85.60 x 53.98
millimeters</a>), which is the exact
size of the Raspberry Pi. Next to it is a piece of card stock cut to the same
53.98-mm length, with the width the same as a 28-pin Atmel ATmega328, which is
about 0.1 inches longer than the 26-pin GPIO header on the RPi. In case you
couldn&rsquo;t identify the other items, they&rsquo;re a die and a U.S. quarter dollar.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/rpio">current board</a> is almost square, but
we&rsquo;re still playing around with the dimensions. It would be interesting to
make the RPio stackable like an Arduino shield. The north end could be raw
GPIO pinouts, and the bottom pins 5-volt level-shifted with extra 3.3-volt
power. I could see many projects being built on those foundations.</p>

<p>As it happens, the board would fit inside an Arduino proto shield. But I&rsquo;m not
sure why that is useful; unless the RPio&rsquo;s headers were soldered so that it
were plugged in beneath the RPi, it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to connect the two at the
same time. And I&rsquo;m having a hard time thinking of a use case where so many I/O
pins would need simultaneous connections between an RPi and an RPio.</p>

<p>If we moved the headers to be separated by exactly 1.0 inch horizontally, then
the board would fit on a standard breadboard with room for a single column of
pins on the left. But unless we routed away the board on the right, it would
be a hassle to reach the breadboard holes on that side. For some reason, I do
see this as slightly more useful than the proto-shield case. You could design
a board that plugged in underneath the RPi for certain functions, then it
would also plug into the breadboard, maybe for testing, or programming, or
diagnostics.</p>
