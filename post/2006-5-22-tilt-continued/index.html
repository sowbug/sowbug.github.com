  <p>Things are looking better:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/DisplayGraph_v1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notable results:</p>

<ul>
<li>$4.40 180-player SNG, <a href="/assets/img/2597.jpeg">1st place</a>, $216 (with a &ldquo;you&rsquo;re disgusting&rdquo; bonus comment from my heads-up opponent after my all-in A4s sucked out against his AJs).</li>
<li>$4.40 180-player SNG, 3rd place, $85.</li>
<li>$4.40 180-player SNG, 10th place, $8.64 (not especially lucrative, but significant nonetheless because I was able to reach the money in 3 of my 4 most recent $4.40 SNGs).</li>
<li>A bunch of smaller SNG finishes in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.</li>
</ul>

<p>My game has tightened up almost ridiculously. Before the final table in the
180-man SNGs, I&rsquo;ve typically seen fewer than 10% of flops. It&rsquo;s agonizing to
fold AQ in middle position, but rewarding that my raises are respected and
that I win most of my showdowns.</p>

<p>The downside is that I&rsquo;ve regressed to almost exclusively Level 1/Level 3
thinking. Either my starting hand is not premium and I fold, or it&rsquo;s a monster
so I can safely skip Level 2 (what&rsquo;s my opponent holding?) and go to Level 3
(how can I make my opponent think I&rsquo;m weak?). This won&rsquo;t hold up against
skilled opponents, who should peg me as a slowplaying rock and refuse to give
me their chips when I am in a pot.</p>

<p>In future games I&rsquo;ll make a couple adjustments: first, play a few more late-
position hands and occasional trash hands, making sure to show these down
cheaply if I can. Second, spend the 90% of the game when I&rsquo;ve folded a hand
paying attention to my opponents&rsquo; play, attempting to build some Level 2
skills. For the 180-player SNGs where I&rsquo;m going to spend perhaps an hour with
the same opponents before a redraw, the study should be especially worthwhile,
as opposed to the turbo SNGs, where players are either weak-tight or super-
aggro, and in any event gone after 20 minutes on average.</p>
