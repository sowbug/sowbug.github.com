<p>The boards tagged <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/avr-
programmer/tags">DORKBOT_1_0_1</a> arrived on Monday. I&rsquo;d somehow forgotten to order the
NX8045-package crystals, so I had to solder a temporary, silly-looking HC49
crystal onto the board. But otherwise, assembly went fairly smoothly.</p>

<p>I followed the usual order of PCB population: add the power circuitry first,
then power it up and read testpoints. All was fine. Then the &ldquo;expensive&rdquo;
(i.e., two-dollar) parts: the &lsquo;32u2, the buffer, and the sockets. More
continuity testing, some examination under the USB microscope for solder
bridges… and then fingers crossed while I plugged it in to USB.</p>

<p><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m17ra8fDkJ1qjj3vh.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Success! Or at least, as much success as I could detect at this point, which
is to say I didn&rsquo;t smell smoke.</p>

<p>I first connected it to my USBtiny and read the default fuses (<a href="http://www.frank-
zhao.com/fusecalc/fusecalc.php?chip=atmega32u2&amp;LOW=5E&amp;HIGH=D9&amp;EXTENDED=F4&amp;LOCKBIT=FF">5e d9
f4</a>),
then tried changing the lfuse to use the internal oscillator (<strong>avrdude -c
usbtiny -p m32u2 -P usb -U lock:w:0x3F:m</strong>). No luck; avrdude kept reporting
&ldquo;verification error; content mismatch,&rdquo; and the fuse stayed as-is. I ended up
looking at some other avrdude command-line invocations on the web and realized
that (1) the lock fuse had been preset to disallow further programming, and
(2) I had to erase the chip with a -e flag to undo that fuse. Achievement, and
fuse, unlocked.</p>

<p>Next, installing the bootloader. I built LUFA&rsquo;s CDCBootloader, then wrote it:
<strong>avrdude -c usbtiny -p m32u2 -P usb -v -e -U flash:w:BootloaderCDC.hex</strong> (by
this point I think the -e was implied, but I spelled it out anyway). I then
disconnected the USBtiny, plugged the programmer into USB, and saw
/dev/tty.usbmodemfa121! My programmer was running code!</p>

<p>Finally, making the programmer a programmer. I built the LUFA AVRISP mkII
clone, then wrote it (**avrdude -p m32u2 -P /dev/tty.usbmodemfa121 -c avr109
*<strong><em>-U </em></strong>*flash:w:AVRISP-MKII.hex**). The serial device vanished, as
expected. My computer&rsquo;s System Information informed me that an AVRISP mkII had
just joined us, and I was able to read from and write to a target 328p on an
<a href="http://evilmadscience.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/74-atmegaxx8">Evil Mad Science breakout
board</a>.</p>

<p>I now know that feeling one feels when a fabbed circuit works on the first
shot. The feeling is mostly surprise… and mostly delight.</p>

<p>P.S. Will someone please tell me why I&rsquo;ve been wasting my time using anything
but <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/">CrossPack</a>?</p>
