  <p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ads/rollerskating/">Two</a>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ads/poplock/">of</a> the current Apple iPod
commercials feature multiple synchronized dancers.</p>

<p>How&rsquo;d they do that with iPods? Each person in the commercial has his or her
own. To the best of my knowledge no iPod can broadcast to another one, nor can
iPods receive FM radio. So did all the dancers start the same song at the same
moment and hope they stayed in sync? Is there an outtake where they&rsquo;re all
quickly exchanging headphones to see if the beats match up? Hmmm, now that I
look more closely, one of the rollerskating guys is a bit out of step with the
other two. Yeah, that guy &ndash; so you see it, too? Good, so it&rsquo;s not just me.</p>

<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re faking it and actually listening to a boom box on the floor
behind the camera.</p>
