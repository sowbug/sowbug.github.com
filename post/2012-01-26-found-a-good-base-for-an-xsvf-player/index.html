<p>Small world. Ben over at the <a href="http://www.gadgetfactory.net/gadgetforum/index.php?topic=277">Papilio
Forums</a> had
almost the same needs as mine: wants to program an XC9572XL, prefers not to
buy overpriced, single-purpose cables. So he adapted the XAPP058 reference
code to a Papilio, cleverly using the desktop machine as a conduit between the
potentially large xsvf file and the firmware.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t try to get Ben&rsquo;s code running on the Papilio, because I have a
different strategy in mind. I have ported the device portion to the Arduino,
and I&rsquo;m going to rewrite the tiny C-based desktop client in Python. It would
be odd for someone to have a CPLD but _not_ have an Arduino within arm&rsquo;s
reach, and while every hobbyist _should_ have a Papilio (hi Jack!), it&rsquo;s less
common. As for the command-line tool, it&rsquo;s straightforward I/O, which means
Python&rsquo;s the perfect choice to get Mac/Windows/Linux/wristwatch support for
free. Last night I got the Arduino communicating with the C client just enough
for the Arduino to start sending debug messages telling me it was very
confused about its purpose in life. Tonight I hope to get it able to program
something on the &lsquo;9572, and then I&rsquo;ll have a known-good toolchain against
which to develop the Python client.</p>

<p>Just a bit of pontificating about <strong>using the right tool for the job</strong>. It
makes me sad when projects with a cross-platform audience use .BAT files, and
it makes me sad any time I see C/C++ where cycle-for-cycle performance isn&rsquo;t
an issue. For shell scripts, use Bash. Install <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> if
your favorite OS is one of the… one that doesn&rsquo;t know Bash. And for pretty
much every other desktop tool you can think of, consider Python rather than C.
People reflexively think of C as the go-to language for portability, but at
the tool level where you care more about how to open a nonblocking serial port
rather than the endianness of an int, Python remains portable where C starts
spewing out #ifdefs.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the topic. When this project is done, any maker will be able
to program a Xilinx CPLD with the hardware and OS he or she already has. No
more ridiculous $50 cables.</p>
