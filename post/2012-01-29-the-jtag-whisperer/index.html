  <p>Available <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/JTAGWhisperer">here on GitHub</a>. The JTAG
Whisperer turns your Arduino into a JTAG cable. <strong>Wow, sounds great!</strong> Here
are the caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s actually just an XSVF player. This is a tiny subset of what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group">JTAG</a> does. The current architecture has the desktop load the XSVF file, then send it over serial to the Arduino. Since serial is going to be limited to the kilobits-per-second range of speed, it&rsquo;s unlikely it&rsquo;ll be suitable for more ambitious interactive JTAG operations. But it&rsquo;d be interesting to see what could be accomplished with the newer Arduinos that have replaced the FTDI chip with the more flexible ATmega U-series chips.</li>
<li>It has been tested only on a <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/CPLD:_Complex_programmable_logic_devices">Xilinx XC9572XL breakout board</a> from Dangerous Prototypes, and the only function it has performed so far is asking the chip its device ID (spoiler: it&rsquo;s 0xf9604093). I would have happily used the <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate">Bus Pirate&rsquo;s XSVF Player firmware</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t yet been ported to my BPv4 hardware, and I wasn&rsquo;t willing to invest in learning PIC development.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t work very well yet. The serial communication between the desktop and the PC frequently gets logjammed, and the Arduino sometimes has to ask repeatedly for the ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have high hopes for this project. Its immediate use will be to program the
&lsquo;9572 so that I can start experimenting with replacing discrete logic 74xx
chips. Eventually I hope it&rsquo;ll become a robust, reliable XSVF player for the
Arduino.</p>

<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/JTAGWhisperer">give it a try</a>. I look
forward to your pull requests!</p>
