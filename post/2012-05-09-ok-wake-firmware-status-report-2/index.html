  <p>Things are looking better.</p>

<p>I wrote a unit test suite that is buildable with regular GCC, so I was able to
get the arithmetic routines written quickly without coaxing tiny LEDs into
telling me the microcontroller&rsquo;s entire internal state. This worked well. I
didn&rsquo;t have to stub or mock out the hardware, but I could see doing that for a
more complex project.</p>

<p>I briefly dabbled in pure shift-based arithmetic (multiply by 205, shift right
11 times!) when I ran out of program space and took a hard look at the
assembly with avr-objdump -S. This didn&rsquo;t work out; doing mod 10 to convert
from decimal to BCD was eye-crossing and approaching the size of the avr-libc
mul/div libraries. Instead I took a different approach.</p>

<p>I hated the AVR310 reference I2C code for its size and seemingly needless
complexity, so I replaced it with Peter Fleury&rsquo;s awesomely tiny <a href="http://homepage.hispeed.ch/peterfleury/group__pfleury__ic2master.html">I2C Master
library</a>.
I couldn&rsquo;t believe that it worked perfectly on the first try. Since it uses
plain GPIOs and doesn&rsquo;t mess with the USI, I could even rework the circuit in
the future to move the button/INT functionality to the &lsquo;25&rsquo;s INT0 pin, getting
more precise pin-change interrupt events in the bargain.</p>

<p>This got me well under 0x700 bytes, so I could once again easily afford to use
*, /, and % (I actually skipped %, preferring to multiply back the division
result and subtract from the original value).</p>

<p>Code&rsquo;s looking good and starting to feed solid.</p>
