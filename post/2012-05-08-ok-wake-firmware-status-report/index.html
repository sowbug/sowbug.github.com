  <p>I have the AVR and the PCF8523 communicating with each other, and the AVR is
mostly able to manipulate its own EEPROM. Things are at least a couple
bugfixes away from working end-to-end, though.</p>

<p><strong>Things I Learned Recently</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The RTC should be reset when the AVR starts up. It&rsquo;s far too easy to leave it with sticky state that causes known-good code to misbehave. Fortunately, resetting leaves the time and alarms intact, so it&rsquo;s nondestructive to do it regularly.</li>
<li>The ATtiny25 has frustrating support for I2C, a.k.a. TWI or two-wire mode. Yes, it has a USART that can do what I&rsquo;ll call hardware-assisted bitbanging of I2C, but the code to actually do that bitbanging uses up lots of program space. The combination of 8-pin AVR, I2C, and small program space is challenging. I think I can do it, but it might be smarter to switch to an ATtiny85 during development so I can add more diagnostics while debugging.</li>
<li>I was spending a lot of time trying to distinguish different reasons why my single interrupt was firing (button-press, /INT low for second interrupt or alarm) without communicating with the &lsquo;8523. The reason for the no-communication part was that the &lsquo;8523 was unavailable within the interrupt (interrupts disabled = no I2C). This was a losing proposition. It was much easier to have the interrupt wake me up, exit the interrupt without doing any work, then ask the &lsquo;8523 via SF/AF whether it wanted me awake. If yes, deal with that. If no, then it must have been the button. This approach is much more solid, and it&rsquo;s what the &lsquo;8523 designers intended.</li>
<li>Doing development with a coin-cell-powered circuit means that your code might start acting weird if the coin cell approaches 1.8V. Better to power via a reliable supply during development.</li>
<li>Power pins and test points would have been a godsend on this ridiculously small board. I should have added a header for V+, GND, /INT, SDA, and SCL. Nice big 0.1&rdquo;-spaced pins to attach logic probes.</li>
<li>Binary-coded decimal is a <em><strong>pain</strong></em> to work with. This is the &lsquo;8523&rsquo;s native number format. I am currently staying in packed BCD for all operations, which neutralizes the annoyance, except for doing time math, where I have to convert back to regular decimal. I need to think harder about whether there&rsquo;s a clever way to multiply/divide by 60 in native packed BCD.</li>
</ul>
