  <h1><a href="https://sowbug.github.io/post/2006-5-25-telephone-tax/" title="Telephone tax">Telephone tax</a></h1>
  <p>As reported in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com
/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052500720.html">this Washington Post article</a>, the government will
finally stop collecting a certain telephone excise tax enacted in 1898 to fund
the Spanish-American War. There&rsquo;s some controversy over the legitimacy of the
tax, so in an unusual move the government is allowing taxpayers to request
refunds of the taxes they paid since March 2003.</p>

<p>Something in the article caught my eye: an explanation why taxpayers have to
go through their own phone bills to add up the taxes they paid, rather than
having the phone companies automatically refund them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be very costly for communications providers to comb their records
and tell consumers how much tax they&rsquo;ve paid, said Annabelle Canning,
assistant general counsel at Verizon Wireless. Verizon has 53 million wireless
customers and provides traditional phone service to 30 million households. &ldquo;It
would take tremendous resources,&rdquo; Canning said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, please. Which takes more resources: asking the phone company to write a
small computer program that adds up taxes paid in its billing database, or
asking 30 million individuals to do the same thing themselves? This is the
same tactic used by rebate programs, which bank on customers forgetting to
send in the rebate forms, or class action settlements, which almost always
require class members to fill out intricate forms to claim their 75-cent
settlement proceeds. If the value of the time required to claim something
exceeds the value of the thing to be claimed, then rational people won&rsquo;t claim
it.</p>
