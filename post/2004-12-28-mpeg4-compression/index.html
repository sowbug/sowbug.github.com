  <h1><a href="https://www.sowbug.com/post/2004-12-28-mpeg4-compression/" title="MPEG-4 compression">MPEG-4 compression</a></h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve done some research into backing up DVDs. The motivation was my
observation that my daughter is sure to destroy at least a few DVDs in the
coming months while she&rsquo;s toddling around the house. Here&rsquo;s the summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000204SWE?tag=sowbug-20"> Philips DVP642 DVD player</a>, which costs about $65 and plays MPEG-4 CDs and DVDs.</li>
<li>Get a DVD burner. This step is optional, but at a minimum you will need a DVD reader.</li>
<li>Download DVD Decrypter and AutoGK (Auto Gordian Knot), or buy Dr. Divx. (I did both.)</li>
<li>Make either 700MB backups using AutoGK&rsquo;s default settings, or 1400MB backups using Dr. Divx.</li>
<li>Get a whole bunch of blanks and backup to DVD or CD-R.</li>
<li>All done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The DVP642 is not perfect, but it&rsquo;s ideal for this application. The playback quality is not on par with some other players I&rsquo;ve seen, as MPEGs seem a little too dark. But it&rsquo;s good enough for people who aren&rsquo;t videophiles like me.</li>
<li>Dr. Divx and DivX5 are not good enough for 700MB compression. Xvid definitely is.</li>
<li>I may change my advice to drop Dr. Divx entirely and back up with AutoGK and Xvid for both 700MB and 1400MB profiles. The only reason I wanted Dr. Divx was so I could produce files that were &ldquo;DivX Home Theater Profile certified,&rdquo; whatever that means. But I&rsquo;ve decided that larger backups might as well include AC3 audio, to avoid lossy transformation from AC3 to MP3. Yet the DivX Home Theater Profile apparently doesn&rsquo;t allow for AC3. I don&rsquo;t know why this is the case, because I can&rsquo;t imagine a Home Theater playback device that could play MP3 but not AC3 (since regular DVDs require AC3 for playback). If I&rsquo;m willing to deviate from the profile by including AC3, then Dr. Divx offers me neither better encoding quality nor assurance of compatibility, so there&rsquo;s no point in using it at all.</li>
</ul>
