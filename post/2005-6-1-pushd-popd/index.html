  <h1><a href="https://www.sowbug.com/post/2005-6-1-pushd-popd/" title="pushd &amp;amp; popd">pushd &amp;amp; popd</a></h1>
  <p>Yesterday I discovered the shell commands pushd and popd. For some reason
every time I read the man pages I didn&rsquo;t grok what they were for, but this
time it clicked.</p>

<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re in some directory somewhere like
~/src/main/project/module/test/data/, and you need to work with a file in your
~/scraps directory. Without pushd and popd, you have three choices: open a new
shell, cd to ~/scraps and then cd back again when you&rsquo;re done, or use path
completion to type the full path to the file in ~/scraps.</p>

<p>But what you really want is the hyperspace button, where you jump to the other
directory, do your work, then jump back wherever you were before. This is what
pushd/popd does:</p>

<pre><code>[~/src/main/project/module/test/data] $ pushd ~/scraps
[~/scraps] $ (work with the file)
[~/scraps] $ popd
[~/src/main/project/module/test/data] $ (I'm back here again!)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can guess from the command names, it&rsquo;s a stack. So you can push all the
locations you want and then get back where you were when you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>A belated thanks to my friend and partner in entrepreneurial endeavors, <a href="http://www.eak.com/"> Erik
Kay</a>, who mentioned these commands to me two years ago.</p>
