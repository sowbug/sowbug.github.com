  <p>These are notes, mostly to myself, about the Tivo I got on August 21, 2001.</p>

<ul>
<li>Model HDR31204 (standalone, Phillips, single-drive, 30 gigabytes, Quantum LCT20, version 1.3).</li>
<li>Quantum drive is really, really quiet.</li>
<li>Downloaded <a href="http://www.9thtee.com/">MFSTools</a> and backed up.

<ul>
<li>Backup was going to be 6 gigs but it failed (couldn&rsquo;t write more than 2 gigs to a file on Windows FAT32 partition).</li>
<li>Tried again with -Tl32 option and the backup was 1.1 gigs, compressed (gzip -9) 383 megabytes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The CR2032 backup battery was never installed in my Tivo. They just plain forgot to do it! I had to go to Target and buy one.</li>
<li>The setup screens are very slick.</li>
<li>I have a AT&amp;T Digital Cable General Instruments cable box. This product/service already sucked ass, but it&rsquo;s so much worse with a Tivo:

<ul>
<li>Can&rsquo;t change channels above 99</li>
<li>Channel changing is slow</li>
<li>Already-annoying banner following every successful channel change is even more annoying)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The program-grabbing stage takes a very long time (about 4 hours for me). It ends up being an almost out-of-body experience. The estimated time never seems to admit that it&rsquo;s going to take longer than it originally thought. Rather than using actual elapsed time as a basis for estimating remaining time, it seems to use original estimate multiplied by percentage remaining, so you get subjective minutes that objectively last 2-3 minutes, kind of like the clock in my grade school.</li>
<li>The next scheduled update call was June 15. I assume that means that if I hadn&rsquo;t manually started an update, it wouldn&rsquo;t have updated for 10 months.</li>
<li>There was a bunch of demo videos on the machine. The content wasn&rsquo;t very interesting but it was really nice to see how high-quality the video was. It looked much, much better than my cable, which I may have mentioned sucks ass.</li>
</ul>
