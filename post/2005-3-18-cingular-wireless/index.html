  <p>AT&amp;T; Wireless customers, one of whom is me, were switched over to
Cingular a few months ago following the merger. My new carrier has a trick to
either get people to pay their bills earlier, or charge them hard-to-dispute
penalties for unintentionally paying a few days late.</p>

<p>Nowhere on the bill does it give a date when the bill is due. Instead, in the
&ldquo;Date Due&rdquo; field it says &ldquo;UPON RECEIPT.&rdquo; In the itemized portion of the bill
it says a &ldquo;late fee may be applied for amounts unpaid 22 days after the date
the invoice was mailed.&rdquo; But there&rsquo;s no indication when the invoice was
mailed. There is no postmark. There is a &ldquo;Date of Invoice,&rdquo; but that could be
before or after the mailing date &ndash; indeed, on my latest bill the itemized
charges stopped three days before the date of invoice, so they could very well
have mailed it with a post-dated invoice.</p>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s impossible to tell with certainty when this 22-day period begins or
ends, most people will simply pay the bill right away rather than risk being
late. And if they are charged a late fee, it&rsquo;ll be hard to determine whether
it was justified.</p>

<p>Evil, inconvenient, and lame.</p>

<p>I hear some readers saying that the due date is &ldquo;right away,&rdquo; and that I have
no right to demand a grace period. The most concise answer I can come up with
to that position is &ldquo;<strong>WRONG</strong>.&rdquo; A slightly less pithy response is that this
is a contract, and both parties should be able to know the exact terms of the
contract.</p>
