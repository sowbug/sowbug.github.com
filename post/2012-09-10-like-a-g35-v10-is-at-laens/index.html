  <h1><a href="https://sowbug.github.io/post/2012-09-10-like-a-g35-v10-is-at-laens/" title="Like A G35 v1.0 is at Laen&#39;s!">Like A G35 v1.0 is at Laen&#39;s!</a></h1>
  <p>Just submitted the design to the fancy new <a href="http://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a>
site. This is my first time using the site since Laen turned the Dorkbot PDX
service into it. The site has a bug or nit here or there, but the previewing
feature is very nice.</p>

<p>As expected, I ditched the RTC feature. But I kept the IR receiver. There are
terminal blocks for three G35 strands, up to three independent WS2801 strands,
and ample power for all passed directly through the fuseless micro-USB power-
only connector. How many lights the Arduino processor itself can drive remains
to be seen. The board is completely passive; there isn&rsquo;t even a capacitor on
it. The major challenge was making sure everything fit without bumping on the
metal USB jacket of pre-Leonardo Arduinos.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/like-a-g35">EAGLE files</a> are on GitHub.</p>
