  <p>In my continuing quest for lucidity, I&rsquo;ve had trouble figuring out exactly
when my personal REM phases occur at night. Preliminary measurements and
intuition suggest that they&rsquo;re happening quite early - as early as two hours
after I sleep. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that the Hypna Go Go, using a naive
time-based scheduling algorithm, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be doing a good job of
guessing the answer, either.</p>

<p>As an experiment, I&rsquo;ve ordered an <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10955">MMA8452Q accelerometer breakout
board</a> from SparkFun, and I&rsquo;m going to
build a new version of the circuit that starts the light programs when I&rsquo;m not
moving, which should be correlated with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia">hypotonia</a> of REM sleep paralysis.
The advantage of this approach versus, say, using an infrared receiver to
measure eye movement, is that the board remains small and simple, without too
many scary parts poking out near my eyes, and easy for me to sew into a
relatively comfortable sleep mask.</p>
