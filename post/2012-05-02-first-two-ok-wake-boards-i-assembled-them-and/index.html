<p>First two <a href="/post/21150945583/ok-wake">OK Wake</a> boards. I assembled them and
wrote a quickie program to test that everything was wired up properly. I
haven&rsquo;t yet run the PCF8523 real-time clock through its paces, but everything
else is working properly.</p>

<p>This board is going to require some nontrivial firmware, and I haven&rsquo;t ever
worked with I2C (or the generic-brand TWI, or two-wire interface) on an AVR,
which means this is going to be a significant opportunity to learn. Because I
didn&rsquo;t have the space for an ISP header, I&rsquo;ll probably develop most of the
firmware on an Arduino or Adafruit &lsquo;32u4 breakout board to avoid having to
constantly unplug the ATtiny25. That will speed up development time, I hope.</p>

<p>I did make one mistake in this circuit. I had a half-baked idea that a 10uF
capacitor could power the RTC during battery changes. I have absolutely no
basis for my belief that that capacitor is large enough to power the RTC
during the 30 seconds it&rsquo;d take to change the battery, but even if it were, I
neglected to put a diode in the circuit to stop the ATtiny from quickly
draining the capacitor. This probably means that changing the battery will be
disruptive. Fortunately, I expect the lifetime of the battery to exceed the
useful lifetime of the board (remember, this is for a friend&rsquo;s children who
aren&rsquo;t yet old enough to read a clock but are likely to respect a color-coded
admonition to stay in bed, and I&rsquo;m sure that in a year they&rsquo;ll have grown out
of that phase).</p>
