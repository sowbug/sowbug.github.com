<p>I killed my <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/CPLD:_Complex_programmable_logic_devices">CPLD Breakout
Board</a>.
While taking pictures of the &ldquo;successful&rdquo; SRAM-loading VHDL I&rsquo;d written and
wired up, I noticed that the power LED on the board was off. I checked the
connections, toggled the power a few times, tried re-running the logic
analyzer, and eventually concluded that the board was dead. It draws 1.4 amps
when I plug it in, and the CPLD itself gets pretty hot. As far as I can tell,
everything else on the board is working (except for the power LED, which now
appears to be inert).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my VHDL:</p>

<pre><code>architecture Behavioral of SRAM_LOADER is
  signal REGISTER_TEMP : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(23 downto 0);
begin
  process (CLK)
  begin
    if (rising_edge(CLK)) then
      REGISTER_TEMP &lt;= REGISTER_TEMP(22 downto 0) &amp; LATCH;
      if OE = '1' then
        ADDRESS &lt;= REGISTER_TEMP(23 downto 8);
        DATA &lt;= REGISTER_TEMP(7 downto 0);
      else
        ADDRESS &lt;= &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&quot;;
        DATA &lt;= &quot;ZZZZZZZZ&quot;;
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end Behavioral;
</code></pre>

<p>I think the tri-stated address and data pins are the problem. None of them
were connected to anything (except four data pins hooked to my logic
analyzer). But I&rsquo;m not at all sure why that would be a problem. The only
reason I think it&rsquo;s related is that one of the last things I did was testing
OE disabled (grounded), but it wasn&rsquo;t the _last_ thing (which was one more OE-
high run to take a picture of the registers shifting), so even that evidence
is questionable. If I&rsquo;d obviously shorted something external to the chip, then
I doubt I&rsquo;d have been able to spend the half-hour or so when I successfully
tested it. That&rsquo;s why I believe I did something wrong with the tri-stating.</p>

<p>If you know a way that one could destroy an XC9572XL CPLD by programming it
incorrectly, I&rsquo;d appreciate a tip.</p>
