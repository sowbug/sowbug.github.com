I do have one question I hope you can help me out with. I am unable to use six strings of 50 lights. They enumerate and complete a test pattern but the programs wont run correctly, usually just the first string will run. If I use just five strings everything works great.

  <p>I’m 99% sure that the problem is that 50 x 6 is greater than 255, which is the
highest value of an unsigned 8-bit octet. The G35 protocol wasn’t designed for
really long strings.</p>

<p>You’re next going to ask why the test patterns run. I’m 1% sure it’s because
you’re hitting memory limits with the 328p. The test patterns are algorithmic
and don’t consume per-light memory, but most of the patterns do allocate a
certain number of bytes per light.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
