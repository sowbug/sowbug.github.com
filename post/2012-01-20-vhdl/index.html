  <blockquote>
<p>The concept of using software to design hardware that runs software will
surely cause you endless hours of contemplation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the six-gig behemoth that is the Xilinx ISE, so it&rsquo;s
taken me longer than expected to get anything resembling Hello World going in
that environment. By comparison, the Arduino IDE is pretty incredible. There&rsquo;s
a lot to be said for a relatively small download and easy installation process
that leads to a blinking LED in maybe five minutes. I know Xilinx and Arduino
are going for entirely different audiences, but ease of installation these
days ought to be a universal feature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m reading _<a href="http://teal.gmu.edu/courses/ECE545/viewgraphs_F04/loCarb_VHDL_small.pdf">The Low-Carb VHDL
Tutorial</a>_
by Bryan Mealy. I&rsquo;m not confused… yet.</p>

<p>Why VHDL and not Verilog? Two reasons: first, all the
<a href="http://opencores.org/">OpenCores</a> processors I&rsquo;ve looked at are written in
VHDL, so even if I were a Verilog master I&rsquo;d have to learn at least to read
VHDL. Second, I&rsquo;ve been told that Verilog is closer to C and thus easier to
learn for C programmers. I&rsquo;m seeking to bend my brain as much as possible
without breaking it, so I&rsquo;ll choose the _harder_ language to learn.</p>
