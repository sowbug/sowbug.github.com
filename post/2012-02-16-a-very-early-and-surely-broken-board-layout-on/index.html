  <p><img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_lzf4slUlMb1qly645o1_1280.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A very early and surely broken board layout. On the left are the power jack,
USB port, and micro-SD slot. The socketed chip in the middle is the SRAM, and
the one on the right is the 6809E. The middle guys are the CPLD, an
ATmega32u4, and the frickin&rsquo; huge oscillator that I will no doubt replace with
an SMD version. A friend has graciously offered to do the layout for real, so
I&rsquo;m not too concerned about the ugly EAGLE autoroutes. I just want to get an
idea of how big the board will be.</p>

<p>Known errors in this version:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no JTAG header. I intend to program the CPLD with the ATmega, but I&rsquo;d like a backup plan.</li>
<li>I might want to consider a fuse. This isn&rsquo;t a general-purpose board with wildly varying current needs or likelihood of short-circuits, but still, it&rsquo;d be smart.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no circuitry to choose between USB and jack power sources. I&rsquo;m OK with this; if I plug in both simultaneously, I deserve the consequences.</li>
<li>I phoned in the capacitor placement. I will read the datasheets and take their advice.</li>
<li>As-is, any SD card placed in the board would burn up. Voltage-dividing resistors between the 5V &lsquo;32u4 and the 3.3V card signals are needed.</li>
<li>Like the oscillator, the SRAM could be switched to an SMD version. Only the 6809E is unavailable as an SMD.</li>
</ul>

<p>Missing functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Video.</li>
<li>Sound.</li>
<li>Game inputs.</li>
<li>Anything that could even theoretically serve as the Williams Special Chip.</li>
<li>Header sockets for a future stacked board that will eventually contain all of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>But this is OK. As long as I add the headers, this will serve as a fairly
functionally complete 6809E-based computer with persistent storage, huge DRAM,
huge ROM, and… virtually no way to demonstrate that it&rsquo;s doing anything at all
except through a logic analyzer or maybe <a href="http://quinndunki.com/blondihacks/?p=610">Quinn&rsquo;s HexOut
tool</a>. Again, this is OK. I&rsquo;ll add
the second stackable board, and that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;ll start to do cool stuff.</p>

<p>Parting thought: if the SRAM is an SMD, the 6809E is rotated 90 degrees, and
things are scrunched together as closely as possible, then it&rsquo;s starting to
look a lot like a very special-purpose Arduino shield. The Arduino would
replace the ATmega, the crystal, the power circuitry, and the ISP header. That
saves a _lot_ of room on the board. In fact, it might even leave room for v2
to have everything from the missing-stuff list. Hmmm.</p>
