  <p>There are eight new <a href="/post/133445471621/weblight">WebLights</a> in the world as
of today!</p>

<p><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/488e05ad2656d50b975e54b41afa1fd5/tumblr_inline_nyyracZqQy1qjj3vh_540.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I did a short run of 10 PCBs (version
<a href="https://github.com/sowbug/weblight/tree/master/hardware/mfg/developer/a-seeed1">a-seeed1</a>)
from <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/">SeeedStudio</a>, placing the order November
10 and receiving it December 3. I decided to try making a solder stencil with
my new <a href="http://amzn.to/1TuFv8y">Silhouette Cameo</a> according to the <a href="http://www.idleloop.com/robotics/cutter/index.php#stencil">excellent
instructions from Cathy
Saxton</a>.</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://amzn.to/1TuF8uI">4 mil mylar</a> for the stencil material. This
required a blade depth of 3 rather than the 1 that Cathy recommended. It’s
possible that 2 would work, but I didn’t notice any scoring on the mat.</p>

<p>My stencil shapes didn’t turn out perfectly square; instead they were each
individually rotated just a bit clockwise. I don’t know why this happened.</p>

<p>But I figured they were close enough to work, so I used that stencil without
trying to debug the process. Otherwise everything was as Cathy said.</p>

<p>I used an old shopping loyalty card to spread the solder paste. I don’t have a
lot to say here because it was fairly easy. I shone a light at an angle that
let me see whether any of the pads were still shiny, and if they were I went
over them again.</p>

<p>After <a href="/post/133444522781/hot-plate-soldering">reflow</a>, only one piece failed:
the reset switch on the very end hadn’t reflowed, so it fell off while I was
moving the boards around. I touched up with a regular soldering iron, and it
was fine.</p>

<p>I decided to throw away the stencil after these eight boards because it was
dirty. I got 25 sheets of 8.5-inch by 11-inch mylar for $14.50, and this was
just a small rectangle of one of those sheets, and making the stencil was so
easy that it didn’t feel precious.</p>

<p>Pick and place is still a horrible, horrible experience. My eyes hurt, my back
hurts, and I feel silly crawling around on my floor looking for one-cent SMT
components that have flicked themselves off my table. (Fun game: find the
upside-down 0805 resistor in this picture.)</p>
