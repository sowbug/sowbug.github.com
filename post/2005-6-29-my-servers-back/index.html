  <p>As all three of you noticed, my server died last Wednesday. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User Mode
Linux</a> server, and my trusty nightly
rsync backup script sorta stopped working back in November 2004, so when the
server disappeared, yeah, I lost some data.</p>

<p>Fortunately, November 2004 was just before my
<a href="http://emilytsao.aboutmybaby.com/">son</a> was born, so blog entries dropped off
dramatically around then, and there wasn&rsquo;t a lot to reconstruct. I got help
from several sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bloglines caches blogs in a format that&rsquo;s pretty faithful to the original. I was able to save their Javascript page, fiddle with it a little, then view the result in my browser. Then I copied the HTML into an HTML editor, and that was close enough to the original content.</li>
<li>For metadata like timestamps, I asked around and luckily a few friends had RSS and Atom feeds left over on their computers. It helps to know people working at a <a href="http://www.qurb.com/">company</a> developing blog software. :) Thanks, Antony and Erik!</li>
<li><a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop Search</a>&rsquo;s web history helped with some HTML recovery.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to get all but about five late-2004 items perfectly recovered.
Apologies in advance when those show up, incorrectly, as &ldquo;updated&rdquo; in your
aggregator.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, I&rsquo;m now hosted at <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>. No
comment yet on their reliability, but their configuration pages are quite
nice. I look forward to the commercialization of
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</a>; I suspect you get more
bang for the buck than UML.</p>

<p>Update: For some reason my registrar decided to switch my domain to their
parked host webserver, so anyone visiting sees a &ldquo;coming soon!&rdquo; page instead
of mine. I believe I fixed the problem two hours ago, but their nameservers
are still serving the incorrect address. What good is a 60-minute TTL if you
can&rsquo;t get your changes published more quickly than that?</p>
