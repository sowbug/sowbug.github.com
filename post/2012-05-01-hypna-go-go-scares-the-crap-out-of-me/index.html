  <p>A couple nights ago I had my first <a href="/post/20906913903/the-hypna-
go-go">Hypna Go Go</a>-influenced dream. I don&rsquo;t remember what had been happening in the
dream, but suddenly a bright drag-race-Christmas-tree-style pole of lights
appeared right in front of me. I realized that this was my signal that I was
dreaming. Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t shake my dream-world concern _why_ the big
red lights were flashing; was it an ambulance? Was it a traffic jam or an
accident? Were my family members hurt? The next couple moments of the dream
were vague and unpleasant, and I woke up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to change anything with the device for now. Yes, the lights are
probably a little too bright, but having replayed the light-pole event in my
mind several times while awake, I believe I can train myself so that next time
it won&rsquo;t be a distressing experience.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at dream recall. I&rsquo;ve written down about
ten dreams, and have been aware that I&rsquo;ve forgotten nearly as many more. This
is much better than a few weeks ago, when it seemed that I had no dreams at
all. And lately I&rsquo;ve been having a sense of general well-being about the
world, which I would expect given that my dreams are often about seeing old
friends and being in interesting places. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s Spring in
my part of the world.</p>
