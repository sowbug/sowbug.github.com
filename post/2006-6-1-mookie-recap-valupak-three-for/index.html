  <p>Three weeks&rsquo; worth of <a href="http://mookie99.bigopokerroom.com/">Mookie</a> tourneys,
condensed into one blog post.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago: raced home from work and registered at 7:00:57, seconds before
registration closed (yay!). My first hand is KK (yay!). One player calls my
big preflop raise (yay!). Flop comes rainbow, Jack-high (yay!). I bet the pot;
other player reraises me all-in (yay!). I call, expecting TPTK, and indeed see
opponent&rsquo;s AJ (yay!). Turn brings an ace (boo!), and I&rsquo;m out. My first sub-
minute Mookie. At least I can feel good that I got all my money in with the
best hand.</p>

<p>One week ago: got no cards the first hour. Then things picked up after the
break, and after a few great hands pitted against slightly-less-great hands, I
was a huge chipleader. Then a couple very weird boards knocked me down a few
pegs. Finally Waffles followed through on his threat to kick my ass next time
I reraised his small-blind steal attempt. This time I had TT, and if it&rsquo;s
possible to call faster than instacalling, Waffles did it with his KK. Out in
5th place, after the bubble.</p>

<p>Last night: lesson learned, or relearned I guess, was just to shut off the
computer and get blinded out rather than trying to play while having a family
discussion. <a href="http://sirfwalgman.blogspot.com/">Waffles</a> (congrats on his
eventual victory in the tournament) got me again; I called a preflop raise
from a third player with my AJs, and Waffles reraised us both. First player
folded; I suddenly came down with a severe case of aw-screw-it, called to see
his AA, then shut off the computer and returned to real life. A complete waste
of $11. Uh, except for the valuable lesson learned, I suppose.</p>
