  <p>Begin rant.</p>

<p>Home solar PV system installation is hot in California right now. It’s hard to
get quotes efficiently. I’m pretty sure this is by design, but it’s still
annoying.</p>

<p>Your goal, as homeowner, is to get a lot of quotes so you can get a good sense
of what the market looks like. Provide a Google Maps view of your roof along
with a few of your past electric bills, indicate whether you’re interested in
cash, financing, or leasing, and that should be enough for them to come up
with a figure.</p>

<p>Their goal, as solar installer, is in part to discourage you from shopping
around. The quicker they incur sunk costs with you, the more likely you’ll
give up and sign a contract.</p>

<p>So the online form looks nice and friendly, but the emails do nothing more
than let you know you’re in the system and they’ll be calling you on the old-
fashioned telephone. Then when they do call you, the main point is to
disqualify you (foam roof, renter, etc.) or else schedule a “free in-person
consultation.” Which is basically a half-day of your time and which doesn’t
scale to 5-10 quotes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even companies you’d expect to be on the tech bandwagon, such
as Solar City (specifically Andrew from (725) 333-xxxx), won’t talk to you
except on the phone, and will ignore emails asking that the initial dance
happen over email.</p>

<p>If a reputable company provided an instant, competitive online quote, I’d
probably sign right away. Recommendations welcome.</p>

<p>End rant.</p>
