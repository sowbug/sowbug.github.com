  <p>Compared to the pre-GUI era, the typical workstation display these days is _
big_. <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs">We&rsquo;re</a> stocking new engineers with dual
1920x1200 <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=320-4221&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=555&amp;category_id=2999">
widescreens</a>.
That&rsquo;s the equivalent of six side-by-side VGA screens! In spite of this growth
over the years, my basic monitor real-estate coding rules haven&rsquo;t changed:
stay within 80 columns, and try to keep each function short enough to fit
vertically on a single screen.</p>

<p>The 80-column rule is a coding style convention that enhances readability and
helps you play nice with your teammates. I&rsquo;m not sure about the origin of the
specific number 80, but it is the default width of a terminal window. A line
of a typical book also happens to average 80 characters, and a book page is
about the widest the human eye can read without getting lost in the middle.
Whatever the exact limit is, it&rsquo;s polite to stay within it because you don&rsquo;t
know the width of the window used by the person reading your code.</p>

<p>Resist the relentless pleas of your teammates to increase the 80-column limit.
Wider monitors enable greater productivity by allowing activities you can&rsquo;t do
on smaller screens, like comfortably diffing two side-by-side GUI windows of
80-column code, or debugging an application while simultaneously stepping
through its code. But you lose these new abilities if a wider monitor merely
means that your code sprawls farther and farther to the right.</p>

<p>The height rule is more of an engineering principle than a mere style
guideline, and as such, it&rsquo;s more subjective. Just as long paragraphs in a
book are tough to slog through because they contain too many ideas, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201485672/qid=1120770637/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_ur_1/103-0344715-4491829?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846&amp;tag=sowbug-20"> long
functions</a>
contain too much code to understand. Splitting one long function into smaller
functions encourages documentation by forcing the programmer to give a
(possibly) meaningful name to each new function. At the same time, the
programmer will probably shorten the overall code by identifying repetitive,
copy-paste code and replacing it with calls to a single general-purpose
function.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had to adjust my function-height rule over the years, but lately
it&rsquo;s making me feel lonely. I&rsquo;m the lone engineer on my team who hasn&rsquo;t
rotated his LCD to portrait position. I see no reason to do so, because it&rsquo;ll
only make it easier to write longer functions.</p>
