<p>It works! Yay! The main problem all along was that I was running the board at
5 volts, not the 3.3 volts it needs. It was able to respond to JTAG commands
at the higher voltage, but it correctly reported that it couldn&rsquo;t write its
flash memory under those conditions.</p>

<p>I still need to update the README for the <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/JTAGWhisperer">JTAG
Whisperer</a>, but the code in the
repository should work right now. Hooray!</p>
