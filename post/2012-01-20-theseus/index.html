  <h1><a href="https://www.sowbug.com/post/2012-01-20-theseus/" title="Theseus">Theseus</a></h1>
  <p>In the middle of a great email exchange with <a href="http://seanriddle.com/">Sean
Riddle</a> (the all-time PageRank leader for Williams
hardware and software), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of
Theseus</a> came up. It&rsquo;s an old
philosophical puzzle where a ship sails around the world, in the process
having broken and worn-out parts replaced as needed. By the time it arrives
back in its home port, every part has been replaced. <em>Question: is it still
the same ship?</em></p>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s a project code name! So here&rsquo;s the proposal: <strong>8821</strong> is project
to understand how a 6809 works in the year 2012. <strong>Theseus</strong> is the project to
resurrect an old Joust while keeping its identity as a Joust. File your
objections with the Review Board within five business days.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2/1/2012: This name didn&rsquo;t stick. It sounds too much like &ldquo;thesis,&rdquo; and I avoided grad school precisely so I&rsquo;d never have to work on one of those.</strong></p>
