<p>There are a couple factors at work here.</p>

<p>First, my <a href="http://www.sowbug.org/mt/archives/000235.html">2nd-place finish</a> at
the $4.40 180-man SNG triggered a textbook case of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle">Peter
Principle</a>; I promoted myself
from my level of competence ($6.50 SNGs) to my level of incompetence ($16 SNGs
and $20 180-man SNGs). There were a few ITM finishes, so these weren&rsquo;t total
disasters. But they were net negative and took a huge chunk from my $200
bankroll that I&rsquo;ve been nursing since 2003.</p>

<p>Second, after exhaustion from 4-tabling for a couple weeks, I wanted to try
thinking a bit deeper about my plays, going beyond the ABC strategy that
generally ekes out a reasonable profit in SNGs. That&rsquo;s a good goal, and it&rsquo;s
obviously crucial to becoming a better poker player, but (a) I&rsquo;m not very good
at it yet, (b) I used it as an excuse to stay longer in second-place hands,
and &copy; I applied it even to turbo SNGs, which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense because
the answer to the question &ldquo;What is my opponent thinking?&rdquo; is almost always
&ldquo;absolutely nothing.&rdquo; A mechanical, tight-preflop, aggressive post-flop
strategy continues to be optimal in turbos, and any second-guessing disguised
as deep thought simply doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>So what to do? Well, notice the little red smudge in the bottom right of the
graph that points upward if you squint. That&rsquo;s me after listening to a podcast
from <a href="http://i.fulltiltpoker.com/images/ourTeam/audio/Pod02
-Jesus-Bankroll.mp3">Chris Ferguson</a>. A couple years ago, as a personal challenge, Ferguson
started with $1 in an online account and worked it up to over $20,000. The
specific numbers aren&rsquo;t particularly interesting; anyone who can afford $1 can
probably afford $100, and $20,000 isn&rsquo;t enough to quit your day job. What is
interesting is Ferguson&rsquo;s discussion of his bankroll management during the
challenge. He never risked more than 5% of his bankroll on any single table.
For example, if he had a $20 bankroll, he would play only $1-buyin ring games,
and $1 tournaments. (Obviously, he had to make exceptions at the very
beginning, because there isn&rsquo;t much you can do with 5 cents even on an online
poker site.)</p>

<p>Besides limiting downside risk &ndash; you won&rsquo;t go broke unless you hit a 20-event
dry spell at the lowest buyins &ndash; Chris&rsquo;s approach creates a nonmonetary
incentive to succeed at individual events based on the assumption that higher-
buyin events are more fun to play. Suppose my bankroll is $120. I can&rsquo;t enter
$6.50 tournaments anymore because that would risk more than 5%. That sucks!
But I do have enough to enter $3.40 tournaments, and if I come in first place,
I now have $132 &ndash; just enough to play <em>one</em> $6.50 tourney.</p>

<p>Applying a new bankroll management strategy, as well as attempting to use the
right basic strategy for SNGs, seems to have stopped the downward slide. I&rsquo;ll
no doubt keep bumping up against incompetence as I build my bankroll and move
up in buyin levels. But if I tilt again, at least it&rsquo;ll be at a lower price.</p>
