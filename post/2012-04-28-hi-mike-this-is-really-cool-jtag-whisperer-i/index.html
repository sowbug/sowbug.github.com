  <p>Python&rsquo;s at <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>. The blog links to the
GitHub project, and it&rsquo;s the top hit on Google for &ldquo;jtag whisperer.&rdquo; If you
have trouble running it, let me know. I&rsquo;m not going to be the best authority
on setting up Python, but there are (probably) a zillion howtos out there.
Good luck and let me know how it goes!</p>
