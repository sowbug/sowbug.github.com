  <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to break the <a href="/post/15856726973/project-8821">Joust rebuild</a>
project into meaningful chunks. My <a href="/post/17728637463/a-very-early-and-surely-broken-board-layout-on">recent attempt at designing a circuit for
manufacture</a>
in EAGLE didn&rsquo;t pan out; it seemed both too big, because I hadn&rsquo;t yet
breadboarded all the sub-circuits as a single large circuit, and at the same
time too small, because it would have been little more than those simple sub-
circuits that I had successfully breadboarded. I&rsquo;d have taken a lot of risk to
fabricate a fairly boring PCB.*</p>

<p>Rather than hem and haw about what exactly to build next for Project 8821, I
decided to take <a href="http://quinndunki.com/blondihacks/">Quinn</a>&rsquo;s approach and
gain experience building a tool that I knew for sure I&rsquo;d need:</p>

<p>This is going to be an <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/avr-programmer">AVR in-system programmer and XSVF
player</a>. True, I could buy a USBtiny
clone for $10 on eBay or a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/46">real one in kit
form</a> for $26 shipped, and in fact I
have plenty of gizmos capable of programming AVRs, but I don&rsquo;t have anything
that can also program CPLDs, the <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/JTAGWhisperer">JTAG
Whisperer</a> notwithstanding. The JTAG
Whisperer is great in a pinch, but I really need it to speak 3.3v and to not
require my Arduino, which is often enlisted in other projects.</p>

<p>And unlike any other AVR programmer I&rsquo;m aware of, <em><strong>mine won&rsquo;t require that
frickin&rsquo; ugly and gigantic 6-pin ISP ribbon cable</strong></em>. See that angled
footprint in the lower-right corner? It&rsquo;s going to have a <em><strong>socket</strong></em>
sticking out of it at a right angle, so it&rsquo;ll be a cinch to stick the board
directly onto the target without <em><strong>any cable whatsoever</strong></em>. (Actually, by
&ldquo;whatsoever&rdquo; I really mean it&rsquo;ll need just a mini-USB cable on the other end,
but those are so commonplace and compatible with other devices that I don&rsquo;t
consider it an inconvenience to keep one on my desk. So it doesn&rsquo;t really
count as a cable.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be sending this board out for manufacture shortly. I&rsquo;m excited about it
because I honestly think it&rsquo;ll be a pretty darn good AVR programmer. I might
have a couple extra boards left over, so if you don&rsquo;t have your own programmer
and need one, leave a comment. I&rsquo;ll probably need one more rev of the PCB and
still have the small matter of writing the firmware, but I&rsquo;d love to have
others using my creations!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: made some changes (VCC separate from 8u2 supply, VCC-5V header removed) after great suggestions from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/frank26080115">frank26080115</a>, who is also the creator of the <a href="http://www.frank-zhao.com/usnoobie/">USnooBie</a>. Thanks, Frank!</p>

<p>*&ldquo;Boring&rdquo; is a strong word. If I stuck a serial port on that board, it&rsquo;d be at least as fascinating as any home computer that existed before the video-capable Apple ][. But I want to stay on project target; if I added a serial port, then I&rsquo;d have to write 6809 software to _use_ it. Given my self-imposed project constraint of avoiding getting into 6809 software and instead treating the Williams ROMs as an invariant, the serial port wouldn&rsquo;t make sense. </p>
