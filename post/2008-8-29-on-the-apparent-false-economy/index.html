  <h1><a href="https://sowbug.github.io/post/2008-8-29-on-the-apparent-false-economy/" title="On the apparent false economy of written documentation">On the apparent false economy of written documentation</a></h1>
  <p>Anyone who&rsquo;s worked with me for more than four hours knows that when it comes
to efficient use of time at the office, I have the soul of an 80-year-old
curmudgeon. I take time to write up documentation with executive summaries,
working hyperlinks, sample code, and FAQs, and in exchange I expect people to
read it. But all too often the pattern goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>Imminent Target Of Rage: Hey Mike, so I saw we have
   a new schema for brillig, and the slithy toves need to
   gyre and gimble in the wabe, and anyway, I saw you sent
   out something about how to do this...

Mike: Yep, the first FAQ entry I sent out has a
   cut-and-paste command-line to whiffle the vorpal sword,
   which gimbles the wabe.

Imminent Target Of Rage: Oh, OK. Command line. I
   uninstalled my shell when the mome raths outgrabe, so
   I could still use some help.

Mike, beginning to seethe: The first FAQ entry also refers
   to the second FAQ entry, which addresses engineers who
   prefer a GUI interface.

Direct Target Of Rage: Hmm, all right. So anyway, I think
   I actually deleted your email with the link to the FAQ.

Mike: We use Google Apps. Nobody at this company deletes
   email.

Direct Target Of Boiling Rage: (long pause) Can you help
   me gimble the wabe?
</code></pre>

<p>Granted, my recounting of this dialogue is one-sided. But there are some
truths in it. Some people read documentation, some people work in a more
verbal or visual fashion, and the two groups will not, by definition, be able
to communicate with each other without either changing their style or finding
a mediator. My usual approach in life has been to demand that others change
their style, because (a) spoken communication is inefficient if it can be
expressed clearly in writing, and (b) I don&rsquo;t want to become the mediator.</p>

<p>For some reason, yesterday I let two neural paths in my mind cross. I was
musing about public speaking and marveling at how much a difference good
preparation makes, and I analogized it to my constant efforts at work to
document every fact or skill worth sharing with my coworkers. If that
documentation is like public-speaking prep work, then at the end of creating
it, and at least for the next day or two until I forget what I wrote, I am
almost certainly the most prepared person on Earth to present wabe gimbling or
sword vorpaling. And if that&rsquo;s the case, why <em>not</em> treat a coworker to the
best damn presentation ever on that topic? Why stew about it?</p>

<p>I still need to quell the efficiency and public-policy demons that scream in
my head as I write this. <em>What about scaling the organization!?! What about
encouraging a culture of independent productivity???!!</em> There&rsquo;s certainly a
balance to be found. But I&rsquo;ve spent a long time over on one end of the scale,
and I&rsquo;d like to try scooting over a bit toward the other side.</p>
