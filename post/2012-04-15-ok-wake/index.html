<p><a href="https://github.com/sowbug/ok-wake">OK Wake</a> is a project for a friend whose
kids are old enough to get out of bed on their own, but not yet old enough to
read clocks, meaning that they tend to start waking up the whole house at 4am.</p>

<p>As it gets close to wake-up time, the device starts gently blinking red. At
the designated hour, it changes to green. That&rsquo;s about it!</p>

<p>The circuit is my first using a real-time clock. I&rsquo;ll be drawing on my power
management experience from the <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/hypnagogo">Hypna Go
Go</a>. I was going to use a surface-mount
ATtiny, but I ran out of pins for ISP, so rather than trying to get clever
with jumpers, I made it socketed instead.</p>

<p>I want to keep the software insanely simple. I hope it requires zero
configuration; it&rsquo;ll just do its thing every day for the couple years it will
take before the kids learn to read. In the event the clock does need to be
set, I think I can figure out something mildly inconvenient but simple
involving the button (like pressing it for one second to reset it to 7pm,
which takes care of timezones within the U.S., and handles any accuracy issues
over the months and years). This scheme could take care of Daylight Saving
Time; either you need to press the button twice a year, or else pressing it
resets it to 7pm <em>of the current day</em>, and the RTC still tracks DST
switchovers.</p>
