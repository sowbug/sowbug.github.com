<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Thompson peered inside his perfect offspring to gain insight into its
methods, but what he found inside was baffling. The plucky chip was utilizing
only thirty-seven of its one hundred logic gates, and most of them were
arranged in a curious collection of feedback loops. Five individual logic
cells were functionally disconnected from the rest– with no pathways that
would allow them to influence the output– yet when the researcher disabled any
one of them the chip lost its ability to discriminate the tones. Furthermore,
the final program did not work reliably when it was loaded onto other FPGAs of
the same type.</p>
