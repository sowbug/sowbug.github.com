<p>Regular readers will <a href="/post/20906913903/the-hypna-go-go">recall</a> that I
haven&rsquo;t had much hypnagogic luck with my blinking LEDs. I theorized first that
the lights weren&rsquo;t bright enough, and second that I wasn&rsquo;t remembering my
dreams no matter how fantastic they were turning out to be.</p>

<h3 id="theory-1-leds-too-dim">Theory #1: LEDs too dim</h3>

<p>I found some better bulbs: water-clear and quite a bit brighter. These are now
so bright that they sometimes wake me up. I&rsquo;m going to try putting some
masking tape over them to diffuse the light.</p>

<h3 id="theory-2-remembering-nothing">Theory #2: Remembering nothing</h3>

<p>This is likely the real problem. I just don&rsquo;t remember dreams very well. This
is probably because I&rsquo;m very alarm-driven in the morning and because my kids
deeply enjoy asking me questions like &ldquo;Dad, when&rsquo;s breakfast?&rdquo; while they know
perfectly well that I&rsquo;m still asleep. My dream consciousness is quickly shoved
into oblivion every morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneirology">Oneirologists</a> (yes, they are a
thing) recommend keeping a dream journal to improve dream memory. Like most
who fail at this endeavor, I first rejected that idea the same way I reject
all diaries (girl stuff, not my style). After a few nights, though, I
developed a sneaking suspicion that the lights <em>were</em> affecting my dreams,
just that I couldn&rsquo;t remember it. I admitted that memory was a deal-breaker.
So I started describing my dreams each morning to my wife. A few days ago I
put a real pen and paper by the bed and have since written down three detailed
dreams.</p>

<p>Now that I have gone through the exercise, I see the value. The problem I had
with keeping a dream journal was that I thought the purpose was dream
analysis, which I honestly didn&rsquo;t care about. But in fact, that&rsquo;s not the
purpose at all. Rather, by training your mind to recall dreams and to place
dream events into your real, normal long-term memory, you gain the ability to
classify dream experiences as dream experiences. This is different from how
your mind normally experiences dreams: &ldquo;Here I am in a small boat in the
middle of the ocean, with nothing but a toy and a cat from my childhood. Seems
legit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By recalling dreams while awake and conscious, you can train yourself to
recognize dreams as dreams after the fact: &ldquo;New rule: when I&rsquo;m inexplicably in
the middle of the ocean,Â <em>it&rsquo;s probably a dream.</em>&rdquo; Presumably, soon my
unconscious self will use the same skills to distinguish dreams from reality,
but <em>at the time the dream is happening</em>. If that alone isn&rsquo;t enough to bring
myself into dream awareness, then the blinking lights ought to give me the
kick I need to do it.</p>
