<p>The proof is in the logic analyzer: it works! Rows 0-4 are A0-A4, or the
lowest-significance address-bus outputs. Row 5 (green) is the reset signal.
The last two rows are the Q/E clocks.</p>

<p>The story this capture tells is exciting! The Q/E clocks are doing their
thing. Then reset goes high, telling the processor to grab the address at
$FFFE, switch the program counter, and start running. So what I&rsquo;m actually
seeing on the address lines (ignoring A4 so we can work with just the bottom
nibble) is E, F, F, 0, 1, F, 0, F, 0, 2, 3, F, 0, F, 0, 4, 5, F, 0, F, 0, 6,
7, F, 0, F, 0â€¦ which mostly matches our expectations (more to come in a full
post). After I took this photo I figured out that Salae can do the bit-math
for me, which is a pretty nice feature.</p>

<p>I believe the reason for the hiccup at the point where reset rises is that the
Salae Logic software is running a circular buffer even before it sees the
start condition, and because I picked a fairly coarse granularity for sampling
(2MHz), it scoots its capturing over a bit to match the rising edge. That&rsquo;s
the only plausible explanation; hitting reset couldn&rsquo;t possibly affect the
clock circuit.</p>
