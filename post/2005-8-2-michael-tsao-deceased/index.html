  <h1><a href="https://www.sowbug.com/post/2005-8-2-michael-tsao-deceased/" title="Michael Tsao, deceased">Michael Tsao, deceased</a></h1>
  <p>I came across the following ominous search term in my webserver logs:</p>

<pre><code>michael tsao death
</code></pre>

<p>Curious about what the world had to say about such an idea, I typed the same
search term into Google and was saddened to see that indeed, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/industries/retailing_restaurants/restaurants/2005/07/25/columbus_daily7.html">Michael Tsao had
died</a>.</p>

<p>Long ago, back in the days when you could email people you found on the web
and they&rsquo;d actually reply, I wrote to the president of Kahiki Foods. I proudly
announced that I, too, was a Michael Tsao, and told him a bit about myself. He
promptly wrote back, saying that his son was also in the tech industry, and
that he wished me well.</p>

<p>That was the extent of my relationship with this Michael Tsao. But even from
my brief contact with him, I know he was a decent guy, and I&rsquo;m sorry that he&rsquo;s
gone.</p>
