  <p>Some bloggers were playing in a blogger-only WSOP satellite Sunday night. Two
short stacks went all-in; one survived. But the survivor had the hammer (7-2
offsuit), and that got <a href="http://biggestron.com/?p=118">the other guy</a> mad, and
some <a href="http://sirfwalgman.blogspot.com/2006/04/get-over-it.html">name-calling</a>
resulted.</p>

<p>It may hurt to hear it, but the hammer player made the right decision, and
wasn&rsquo;t acting at all in an &ldquo;essentially random fashion.&rdquo; In low-M situations,
the cards aren&rsquo;t that important. You can&rsquo;t afford to see a flop without first
exploiting the fold equity of your stack. If you did limp in with half your
stack, your opponent would put you all-in on the flop no matter what. So your
only move is to go all-in preflop the first time it&rsquo;s folded to you. You hope
that everyone else folds, or someone calls with two cards that don&rsquo;t pair up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this works in the other direction, too. The larger stack is
going to assume the short stack is playing aggressively:</p>

<pre><code>PokerStars No-Limit Hold'em Tourney,
Big Blind is t3000 (3 handed)

Sowbug (t146659)
Button (t89108)
SB (Victim) (t34233)

Preflop: Sowbug is BB with 4h, Qs.    
1 fold, SB (Victim) raises to t9000, Sowbug raises to t15000,
SB (Victim) raises to t34083, Sowbug calls t19083.

Flop: (t68316) 2s, 7c, 4s (2 players)
Victim said, &quot;what?&quot;

Turn: (t68316) Jd (2 players)

River: (t68316) 7s (2 players)

Final Pot: t68316

Results below:  
Sowbug has 4h Qs (two pair, sevens and fours).  
Victim has Qh Ad (one pair, sevens).  
Outcome: Sowbug wins t68316.

<p>Much of the preflop raising was just posturing on my part, but Victim&rsquo;s all-in
gave me excellent pot odds (2.6 to 1). Against
22+,ATs+,KTs+,QTs+,JTs,ATo+,KTo, Q4o was a 2.2 to 1 underdog, so I had little
choice but to call. Granted, I didn&rsquo;t do this calculation at the time; I knew
I&rsquo;d call when I had to put in 19,083 to win 49,233 and have a chance at
guaranteeing at least a second-place finish.</p>
