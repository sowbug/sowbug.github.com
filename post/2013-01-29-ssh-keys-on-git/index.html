  <p>Long ago on a Q&amp;A site I used to frequent, I asked why GitHub didn&rsquo;t let
me associate a single SSH public key with two accounts. I had a work account
and a personal account on GitHub, I wanted to use them both on one computer,
and it&rsquo;s a pain in the neck to get Git to use the right one of multiple SSH
keys to connect to a single host. (It&rsquo;s solvable; you have to change your ssh
configuration to define different Hosts, each with a different key, that
resolve to the same hostname, and then tell Git to connect to a Host rather
than a hostname.) I imagined that GitHub should be able to say that if I&rsquo;m
connecting to Repository X with Key A, I&rsquo;d be recognized as Person M, but I&rsquo;d
be recognized as Person N with the same key in Repository Y. Why couldn&rsquo;t
GitHub do this?</p>

<p>I got a perfectly reasonable answer right away on the Q&amp;A site that GitHub
uses SSH to tell who you were, so it can&rsquo;t be done from a technical
perspective. I found the answer wanting, though - why did GitHub use SSH? Why
couldn&rsquo;t the SSH identity map to a different concept? Wasn&rsquo;t this SSH-owns-
identity thing a big price to pay?</p>

<p>I got the answer while reading <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-
the-Server-The-Protocols">Pro Git</a>. It turns out that Git doesn&rsquo;t know anything about
authentication, and SSH is the only practical wrapper protocol that allows
write access to a repository. (The other protocols are local file access, the
completely anonymous Git protocol, and HTTP, but none easily allows
authenticated access.) So it&rsquo;s likely that on a given server, the git process
is running as &ldquo;you&rdquo; (whoever you are who ssh&rsquo;ed into the server), and the
sysadmin has set up standard Unix permissions on the .git repo directory to
control who has read/write access. Thus Git read/write operations are
automatically permitted or not without a single line of code in Git. Very
Unix-y.</p>

<p>Does this mean that my original feature request (SSH Key A means you&rsquo;re Person
M in Repo X and Person N in Repo Y) is impossible? No; there is probably a way
to map an SSH user to a specific machine user based on contextual clues like
the directory you&rsquo;re trying to access. But the way it is today, where SSH Key
M means you&rsquo;re Person M only and nobody else, is a lot easier from the
perspective of someone hacking together a young service like GitHub and making
a bunch of shell scripts that set access properly across repositories.
Moreover, it avoids the edge case where Person M joins Person N&rsquo;s company and
now has access to Repo Y, so the already-weirdish heuristic to determine who
you are breaks down. The higher-level solution GitHub came up with,
Organizations, solves the problem more elegantly without requiring (or
allowing) a single person to assume multiple identities on the system.</p>
