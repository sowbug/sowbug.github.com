<p>I am not usually this smart. I was fretting about how to get accessible
pinouts to the tiny SOIC-8 PCF8523 while developing the OK Wake firmware on an
Arduino. I thought about dead-bug wires, or picking up an SOIC breakout board
from a local store, or doing something ugly with perfboard. I briefly explored
repurposing an old unpopulated PCB, like maybe the third Hypna Go Go PCB from
Laen, which uses an SOIC-8 for its ATtiny13a.</p>

<p>Then I realized that the OK Wake itself was the perfect board! Just connect
the ATtiny socket&rsquo;s pins to the corresponding pins on the big brother Arduino.
That&rsquo;s what I did, and it&rsquo;s working very nicely. And as a bonus, I didn&rsquo;t have
to sacrifice any PCBs or extra PCF8523s.</p>

<p>Kind of obvious in retrospect. But in mental cycles expended, I definitely
earned it.</p>

<p><strong>[Update from a couple hours later]Â </strong>I&rsquo;ve successfully done the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the Arduino&rsquo;s Wire I2C library, read the seconds from the &lsquo;8523 and confirmed that they increment properly.</li>
<li>Turned off the CLKOUT default settings, which were messing up /INT.</li>
<li>Set SIE, which enables the once-a-second interrupt on /INT.</li>
<li>Configured TAM to pulse the /INT interrupt so I don&rsquo;t have to clear it.</li>
<li>Confirmed with my logic analyzer that the pulse is indeed <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub> seconds long.</li>
<li>Got the Arduino firing an interrupt routine when /INT goes active.</li>
<li>Confirmed that the button and the &lsquo;8532 /INT signal don&rsquo;t interfere with each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, unless the ATtiny is weirdly different from the &lsquo;328, then the
circuit is in perfect working order.</p>
