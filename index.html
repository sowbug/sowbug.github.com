      <p>The arrival of the Tesla Model 3 is the the electric-vehicle ecosystem&rsquo;s make- or-break moment. With the Model 3, Tesla has solved the problem of delivering high EV range at low cost. If Tesla can deliver as promised, nothing more will be standing in the way of EV success.
That is, nothing except charging.
Today, electric cars follow the smartphone-charging model: plug in at home or work, do something else for a while (hours), and unplug.</p>

      <p>A theme develops.
Taxi operators complain about the unfair advantage that Uber and Lyft enjoy from not having to comply with burdensome regulation:
 [We] expect more and more legislation will be passed that further levels the playing field.
 Yet taxi operators originally pushed for this legislation to keep out competition.
Now car dealerships in a few states are trying to ban Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers, and once again they&rsquo;re complaining about Tesla&rsquo;s unfair advantage:</p>

      <p>Latest WebLight.
Interesting features of this spin are that it’s 2.0mm thickness (still a little thin but operational), and two-sided (thanks to Passerby for circuit tip).
There are two bugs. One, the board was too wide. I forgot to resize it after removing the metal connector from the layout. So I filed down the edges around the USB connector, and it’s fine. Two, part of the top ground plane got disconnected from the rest, so the left LED’s ground is floating.</p>

      <p>As far as I can tell, the latest 1.1.7 BIOS update for the XPS 13 removes the ability to charge via USB Power Delivery at 5 volts. I didn’t do a lot of testing, but I know that when I first got the machine, it did charge from a Nexus 6P charger plugged into the Thunderbolt/USB Type C port. Slowly, and the BIOS griped at boot, but it did charge.</p>

      <p>These are my notes about what I&rsquo;ve done to my new laptop. It&rsquo;s the non-touch i5 8GB/128GB model, whose SSD is SATA and not PCIe.
 Threw out the Broadcom WiFi adapter and replaced it with an Intel 7265. Installed BIOS 1.1.7, which today is available only on the UK site. Installed Ubuntu 15.10. I shrank the Windows partition to about 45GB and otherwise went with the installation defaults. Installed the latest 4.</p>

      <p>I want a device that looks nice enough to keep on a coffee table, that has a small number of buttons, that emits well-documented RF signals in response to those buttons, that has some kind of reasonable security story, and that is manufactured in enough quantity that it’s cheap and not hard to find. This would be a hobbyist remote control. It would allow me to build ugly devices that I could hide in a cabinet, then control them with something not ugly.</p>

      <p>There are eight new WebLights in the world as of today!
I did a short run of 10 PCBs (version a-seeed1) from SeeedStudio, placing the order November 10 and receiving it December 3. I decided to try making a solder stencil with my new Silhouette Cameo according to the excellent instructions from Cathy Saxton.
I used 4 mil mylar for the stencil material. This required a blade depth of 3 rather than the 1 that Cathy recommended.</p>

      <p>WebLight is a WebUSB blinky light device. You plug it in to a computer running a browser that supports the WebUSB standard (currently only recent Chrome builds that have certain chrome:flags enabled), and without requiring any driver installation, it just works. Each LED module is RGB and individually controllable.
The first prototypes aren’t much to look at. I intend the final version to use micro-USB and fit comfortably in a plastic LED-candle holder.</p>

      <p>All the articles on the web are true. It’s possible to do high-quality SMD soldering at home. And it’s easy.
First, acquire materials. Get a $14 hot plate and a $12 syringe of 63&frasl;37 solder paste. Then if you don’t have one already, get a multimeter with a temperature probe. Next, I recommend a roll of Kapton tape. And then finally, find some PCBs and surface- mount parts for practice.</p>

I do have one question I hope you can help me out with. I am unable to use six strings of 50 lights. They enumerate and complete a test pattern but the programs wont run correctly, usually just the first string will run. If I use just five strings everything works great. Tried an Arduino Uno and a Mega2560.</a></h1>
      <p>I’m 99% sure that the problem is that 50 x 6 is greater than 255, which is the highest value of an unsigned 8-bit octet. The G35 protocol wasn’t designed for really long strings.
You’re next going to ask why the test patterns run. I’m 1% sure it’s because you’re hitting memory limits with the 328p. The test patterns are algorithmic and don’t consume per-light memory, but most of the patterns do allocate a certain number of bytes per light.</p>

      <p>This works for the blue FIDO U2F key.
Create a new file called /etc/udev/rules.d/50-security-key.rules:
**SUBSYSTEMS==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;1050&quot;, OWNER=&quot;root&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;, MODE:=&quot;0660&quot;**
Once that file is saved, sudo udevadm control -reload-rules and then restart Chrome. Your security key, which previously was likely giving you a “An unexpected error occurred [retry]” message, will now work.
I figured this out with the command udevadm info -n /dev/usb/hiddev0 -a, inspecting the output to determine that other solutions on the web were missing the S at the end of SUBSYSTEMS and ATTRS.</p>

      <p>Begin rant.
Home solar PV system installation is hot in California right now. It’s hard to get quotes efficiently. I’m pretty sure this is by design, but it’s still annoying.
Your goal, as homeowner, is to get a lot of quotes so you can get a good sense of what the market looks like. Provide a Google Maps view of your roof along with a few of your past electric bills, indicate whether you’re interested in cash, financing, or leasing, and that should be enough for them to come up with a figure.</p>

      <p>My latest GitHub project, paSSSphrase, was inspired by a recent Instructable about electroetching digital assets.
The basic idea is to split a strong passphrase among multiple shares according to Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing algorithm, then generate an inverted/mirrored image of the shares as QR codes. The image transformations make for an easy electroetching stencil.
So far I haven&rsquo;t actually done this process for a secret I care about. But I thought electroetching was interesting enough to want to spend a few evenings working on it.</p>

Bitcoin is like cash, except every person you ever do business with writes down the serial numbers of each bill in a ledger that&rsquo;s available to everyone forever.

 Bitcoin will not stick it to The Man. It&rsquo;s romantic to think that Satoshi invented a parallel world where we can lead normal lives by day and rent nuclear-powered tax-free hookers at night.</p>

In addition to the G35 protocol that I know and love, this board was supposed to support the WS2801 protocol. It turns out that WS2801 happens to work really well with hardware SPI, as do lots of other chips, such as the SM16716 and LPD8806, all of which are supported by the FastSPI project.</p>

So it&rsquo;s not surprising that the Hypna Go Go, using a naive time-based scheduling algorithm, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be doing a good job of guessing the answer, either.
As an experiment, I&rsquo;ve ordered an MMA8452Q accelerometer breakout board from SparkFun, and I&rsquo;m going to build a new version of the circuit that starts the light programs when I&rsquo;m not moving, which should be correlated with the hypotonia of REM sleep paralysis.</p>

Things I Learned Recently
 The RTC should be reset when the AVR starts up. It&rsquo;s far too easy to leave it with sticky state that causes known-good code to misbehave. Fortunately, resetting leaves the time and alarms intact, so it&rsquo;s nondestructive to do it regularly.</p>

      <p>First two OK Wake boards. I assembled them and wrote a quickie program to test that everything was wired up properly. I haven&rsquo;t yet run the PCF8523 real-time clock through its paces, but everything else is working properly.
This board is going to require some nontrivial firmware, and I haven&rsquo;t ever worked with I2C (or the generic-brand TWI, or two-wire interface) on an AVR, which means this is going to be a significant opportunity to learn.</p>

      <p>A couple nights ago I had my first Hypna Go Go-influenced dream. I don&rsquo;t remember what had been happening in the dream, but suddenly a bright drag-race-Christmas-tree-style pole of lights appeared right in front of me. I realized that this was my signal that I was dreaming. Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t shake my dream-world concern _why_ the big red lights were flashing; was it an ambulance? Was it a traffic jam or an accident?</p>

      <p>When I was debugging this thing, the Arduino serial connection (which uses software flow control, a.k.a. no flow control) was getting confused or falling behind. Try setting both sides to a very low bitrate (like 9600 or 2400).
Do you have a logic analyzer? That was invaluable in isolating problems.
Are you sure that the target board doesn&rsquo;t have any jumper/power requirements? My board needed two power sources: one for the core, and one for the I/O.</p>

The AVR Programmer initially worked with a target &lsquo;328p, but it hung when programming a second build of the board, and then again on a particular ATtiny13A that I was using for the Hypna Go Go. Oddly, it worked for another &lsquo;13A that I was using on the same project. The board was flaky, and as a result, I couldn&rsquo;t keep my promise to myself to never again ISP-program another AVR without a programmer I&rsquo;d built myself.</p>

 Added an FTDI-cable-compatible header. This means the board has the hardware capability to do USB-TTL serial I/O, and it should be able to program Arduino Pros and other barebones Arduinos. Dropped the two ground pins on the VCC/3.3&frasl;5.0 header. The original idea was to make it possible for that header to act as a small power source, but it turned out to be a confusing opportunity for short circuits.</p>

This weekend I whipped up a breakout board for the Raspberry Pi. The RPio bidirectionally level-shifts the GPIO pins between their 3.3-volt level and a more hobbyist-friendly 5 volts. It also provides more 3.3-volt power than the meager 50mA provided from the RPi&rsquo;s expansion header.

Because the AVR Programmer will support SPI-based ISP, PDI for XMEGAs, and TPI for low-end &lsquo;tinys, I need to acquire test targets of each kind. Unfortunately, XMEGA isn&rsquo;t available as a DIP, which means it&rsquo;s breakout board time.
I&rsquo;ve made a half-hearted resolution to design and build rather than buy tools where possible, because, well, because building is fun.

      <p>LUFA is pretty amazing. If you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing, you can make your USB-capable AVR microcontroller be 100 virtual serial ports, all communicating with other, all at once. I&rsquo;m not sure why it took me a few hours to get even one virtual port to appear, but once I followed my own steps to restore my &lsquo;32u4 breakout board to factory-fresh condition, it worked nicely. Here are my notes:</p>

Many thanks to DG who manually routed a interim version of the board, and shaved off all but four vias and about a half square-inch of PCB. Unfortunately I made a few more enhancements and added 14 more vias in the process.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to break the Joust rebuild project into meaningful chunks. My recent attempt at designing a circuit for manufacture in EAGLE didn&rsquo;t pan out; it seemed both too big, because I hadn&rsquo;t yet breadboarded all the sub-circuits as a single large circuit, and at the same time too small, because it would have been little more than those simple sub- circuits that I had successfully breadboarded.

 Dr. Thompson peered inside his perfect offspring to gain insight into its methods, but what he found inside was baffling. The plucky chip was utilizing only thirty-seven of its one hundred logic gates, and most of them were arranged in a curious collection of feedback loops. Five individual logic cells were functionally disconnected from the rest– with no pathways that would allow them to influence the output– yet when the researcher disabled any one of them the chip lost its ability to discriminate the tones.</p>

Sigh.
With this newly understood information, I hope to discover that the JTAG Whisperer is working correctly, and that the incorrect voltage was preventing the CPLD from programming itself. Other possibilities are (1) my code is still buggy but the CPLD is happy to be finally running at the right voltage, and (2) I&rsquo;ve fried my poor little &lsquo;9572.</p>

      <p>This is the version of the Papilio One as built by SeeedStudio. It&rsquo;s possible that versions built by other manufacturers are slightly different; it&rsquo;s open-source hardware, so in theory many people might build it. These notes are for Linux (Ubuntu 11.10 in my case).
 The headers arrive separate from the board. You&rsquo;ll need to cut off sections with wire cutters, and you should expect and plan to sacrifice one pin per cut.</p>

      <p>As I improve the board design in my head, I think I can eliminate the EEPROM and downgrade the ATmega to an ATtiny. The design will now read files off an SD card instead. The ATtiny will populate a bank of the SRAM and present that to the 6809 as ROM, using the CPLD as a stand-in for a series of &lsquo;595s. The &lsquo;tiny will also load the FPGA, both from files on the SD card.</p>

 Move to protoboard and do permanent wiring underneath with headers on top for further experimentation. Split out into two or more breadboards with ribbon connectors between them. This isn&rsquo;t actually any better than what I have now, but it&rsquo;d be a chance to refactor the wiring and IC arrangement.</p>

The story this capture tells is exciting! The Q/E clocks are doing their thing. Then reset goes high, telling the processor to grab the address at $FFFE, switch the program counter, and start running. So what I&rsquo;m actually seeing on the address lines (ignoring A4 so we can work with just the bottom nibble) is E, F, F, 0, 1, F, 0, F, 0, 2, 3, F, 0, F, 0, 4, 5, F, 0, F, 0, 6, 7, F, 0, F, 0… which mostly matches our expectations (more to come in a full post).</p>

      <p>As reported in this Washington Post article, the government will finally stop collecting a certain telephone excise tax enacted in 1898 to fund the Spanish-American War. There&rsquo;s some controversy over the legitimacy of the tax, so in an unusual move the government is allowing taxpayers to request refunds of the taxes they paid since March 2003.
Something in the article caught my eye: an explanation why taxpayers have to go through their own phone bills to add up the taxes they paid, rather than having the phone companies automatically refund them:</p>

      <p>There are a couple factors at work here.
First, my 2nd-place finish at the $4.40 180-man SNG triggered a textbook case of the Peter Principle; I promoted myself from my level of competence ($6.50 SNGs) to my level of incompetence ($16 SNGs and $20 180-man SNGs). There were a few ITM finishes, so these weren&rsquo;t total disasters. But they were net negative and took a huge chunk from my $200 bankroll that I&rsquo;ve been nursing since 2003.</p>

      <p>This is embarrassing. For years I&rsquo;ve extracted .tar.bz2 files by the two-step &ldquo;bunzip foo.tar.bz2 &amp;&amp; tar xf foo.tar&rdquo; method, but it was annoying that tar didn&rsquo;t know what to do with .bz2 archives and thus wasn&rsquo;t as convenient as &ldquo;tar xzf foo.tar.gz.&rdquo; Well, last night I discovered tar&rsquo;s -j option, which does the same thing for bzipped archives as -z does for gzipped archives. Hooray!</p>

      <p>If you are having trouble updating the firmware on your Buffalo Linkstation or Kuro Box using Windows XP, try turning off your computer&rsquo;s firewall. The setup program appears to use UDP in both directions, possibly sending and receiving on different ports, and the default settings of the XP firewall interfere with the traffic. I&rsquo;m sure the setup program warns you somewhere to do this, but if you&rsquo;re like me, you typically ignore all those warnings.</p>

      <p>Yesterday on the XM Radio station Chrome I heard the long version of Gloria Gaynor&rsquo;s disco anthem I Will Survive for the first time. It&rsquo;s quite impressive. The version you&rsquo;re probably used to hearing is about three minutes long. But the long version is basically her singing the whole song all over again. Toward the end the drummer starts doing some really funky improvisations, like he&rsquo;s had an itch for a while and needs to scratch without missing any beats.</p>

I base this belief on a simple application of game theory. There are two possible cases: either the government will never allow imports, or it eventually will.
Start with the first case. If the government does not allow imports, then U.S. drug companies will continue to have a collective monopoly on the U.</p>
