## About the\_program

the_program is inspired by [docco.coffee](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/).
Designed for documenting programming language, but you can certenly use this
any other purpose.

- Design is simple so is the code behind it. You can easily customize it.
- Built with mobile first.
- Written with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) so if you need to edit it, you should get [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). I use this app to develop this theme.
